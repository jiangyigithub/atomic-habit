We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our
status. We `trim our hedges` and `mow our lawn` because we don’t want
to be the `slob` of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit,
we clean up the house because we don’t want to be judged. We are
continually wondering “What will others think of me?” and altering
our behavior based on the answer.

The Polgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginning
of this chapter—are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact social
influences can have on our behavior. The sisters practiced chess for
many hours each day and continued this remarkable effort for
decades. But these habits and behaviors maintained their
attractiveness, in part, because they were valued by their culture. From
the praise of their parents to the achievement of different status
markers like becoming a grandmaster, they had many reasons to
continue their effort.
