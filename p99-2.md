You can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking
strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your
behavior.

The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:

1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

If you want to read the news, but you need to express more
gratitude:
1. After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful
for that happened yesterday (need).
2. After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).

If you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls:
1. After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three potential
clients (need).
2. After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).

If you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more:
1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).
2. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).
