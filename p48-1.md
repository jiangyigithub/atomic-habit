This four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your
brain runs through these steps in the same order each time.

First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a
behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our
prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the
location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend
most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like
money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and
friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these
pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction,
which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)
