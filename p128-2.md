Chapter Summary

The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy.

The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.

Focus on taking action, not being in motion.

Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes
`progressively` more automatic through repetition.

The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as
important as the number of times you have performed it.
