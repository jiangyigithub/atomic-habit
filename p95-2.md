When it comes to habits, the key `takeaway` is this: dopamine is
released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you
anticipate it. `Gambling` addicts have a dopamine spike right before
they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get `a surge of`
dopamine when they see the `powder`, not after they take it. Whenever
you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of
dopamine `spike` in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so
does your motivation to act.

It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets
us to take action.

Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when
you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you
anticipate a reward. This is one reason the anticipation of an
experience can often feel better than the `attainment` of it. As a child,
thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the
gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be
more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this
as the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”
