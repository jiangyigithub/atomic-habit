Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and
life is a struggle.

How do you pick the right habit? The first step is something we
covered in the 3rd Law: make it easy. In many cases, when people pick
the wrong habit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too
difficult. When a habit is easy, you are more likely to be successful.
When you are successful, you are more likely to feel satisfied.
However, there is another level to consider. In the long-run, if you
continue to advance and improve, any area can become challenging. At
some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for
your skillset. How do you figure that out?

The most common approach is `trial` and error. Of course, there’s a
problem with this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try
every career, date every `eligible` bachelor, or play every musical
instrument. Thankfully, there is an effective way to manage this
`conundrum`, and it is known as the explore/`exploit` trade-off.
