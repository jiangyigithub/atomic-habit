Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of
using the elevator.

Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to
someone I don’t know yet.

Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait
twenty-four hours before purchasing.

Healthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put
veggies on my plate first.

Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away.
(“One in, one out.”)

Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and
smile before answering.

Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table
and chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.
