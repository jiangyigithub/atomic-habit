Now consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As
the game progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You
have a good chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your focus
narrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested in
the task at hand. This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and it
is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation
when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current
abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.
