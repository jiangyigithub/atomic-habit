In our data-driven world, we tend to `overvalue` numbers and
`undervalue` anything `ephemeral`, soft, and difficult to quantify. We
`mistakenly` think the factors we can measure are the only factors that
exist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s
the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure
something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.

All of this to say, it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its proper
place. It can feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress,
but the measurement is not the only thing that matters. Furthermore,
there are many ways to measure progress, and sometimes it helps to
`shift` your focus to something entirely different.

This is why `nonscale` victories can be effective for weight loss. The
number on the scale may be `stubborn`, so if you focus solely on that
number, your motivation will `sag`. But you may notice that your skin
looks better or you wake up earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of
these are valid ways to track your improvement. If you’re not feeling
motivated by the number on the scale, perhaps it’s time to focus on a
different measurement—one that gives you more signals of progress.

No matter how you measure your improvement, habit tracking
offers a simple way to make your habits more satisfying. Each
measurement provides a little bit of evidence that you’re moving in the
right direction and a brief moment of immediate pleasure for a job
well done.
