For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?”
It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus
shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person
who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).

This process can lead to beliefs like:
“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.”
“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and
`empathy` they need.”
“I’m the kind of manager who `advocates for` her employees.”

Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you
can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a
friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a
healthy person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a
guide. Would a healthy person walk or take a `cab`? Would a healthy
person order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a
healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person.
She was right.
