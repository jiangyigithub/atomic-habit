People often think it’s `weird` to `get hyped about` reading one page or
meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is
not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of `showing up`.
The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If
you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope
of mastering the finer details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect
habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You
have to standardize before you can optimize.

As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply
become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely
a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a
difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the
more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus
that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before
every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak
performance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easier
to get into the hard work of creating. By developing a consistent
power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable
time each night. You may not be able to automate the whole process,
but you can make the first action mindless. Make it easy to start and
the rest will follow.
