Employee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six
months, Patterson’s business went from losing money to making
$5,000 in profit—the equivalent of more than $100,000 today.

Patterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed
businesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s invention and opened the
National Cash Register Company. Ten years later, National Cash
Register had over one thousand employees and was on its way to
becoming one of the most successful businesses of its time.

The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do.
Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. The
brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by
making stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change
the employees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.
