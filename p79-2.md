HOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS

During the energy crisis and oil `embargo` of the 1970s, Dutch
researchers began to pay close attention to the country’s energy usage.
In one suburb near Amsterdam, they found that some homeowners
used 30 percent less energy than their neighbors—despite the homes
being of similar size and getting electricity for the same price.

It turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical
except for one feature: the location of the `electrical meter`. Some had
one in the basement. Others had the electrical meter upstairs in the
main hallway. As you may guess, the homes with the meters located in
the main hallway used less electricity. When their energy use was
obvious and easy to track, people changed their behavior.

Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice
cues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live
and work often make it easy not to do certain actions because there is
no obvious cue to trigger the behavior. It’s easy not to practice the
guitar when it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a book
when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room. It’s easy not to
take your vitamins when they are out of sight in the `pantry`. When the
cues that spark a habit are `subtle or hidden`, they are easy to ignore.
