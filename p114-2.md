Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New
versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior
remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the
period of history.

Hereâ€™s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address
the same underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress
by smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to `ease` their anxiety by
going for a run. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to
solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to
use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve,
you keep coming back to it.
