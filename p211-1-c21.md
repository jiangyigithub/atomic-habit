The Secret to Results That Last

THERE IS AN ancient Greek parable known as the Sorites Paradox,*
which talks about the effect one small action can have when
repeated enough times. One formulation of the paradox goes as
follows: Can one coin make a person rich? If you give a person a pile of
ten coins, you wouldn’t claim that he or she is rich. But what if you add
another? And another? And another? At some point, you will have to
admit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her so.

We can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny change
transform your life? It’s unlikely you would say so. But what if you
made another? And another? And another? At some point, you will
have to admit that your life was transformed by one small change.

The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent
improvement, but a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits
stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of the overall system.
