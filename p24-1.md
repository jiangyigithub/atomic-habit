This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that
last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and
decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so
why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking
takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order
to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to
break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent
Potential.

If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad
one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often
because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.
Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like
complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from
twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just
being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.
