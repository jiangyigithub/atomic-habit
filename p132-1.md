In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really
want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to
feeling calm. `Journaling` is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t
actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the
habit delivers. The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the
habit—the more `friction` there is between you and your desired end
state. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do
them even when you don’t feel like it. If you can make your good
habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on
them.

But what about all the moments when we seem to do the opposite?
If we’re all so lazy, then how do you explain people accomplishing hard
things like raising a child or starting a business or climbing Mount
Everest?

Certainly, you are capable of doing very hard things. The problem is
that some days you feel like doing the hard work and some days you
feel like giving in. On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many
things working in your `favor` as possible so that you can overcome the
challenges life naturally throws your way. The less friction you face,
the easier it is for your stronger self to `emerge`. The idea behind make
it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as
possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.
