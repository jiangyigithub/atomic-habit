Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.

This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own
form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to
complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the
calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your
investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it
feels good, then you’re more likely to endure.

Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused
on the process rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting six-
pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the
type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.
