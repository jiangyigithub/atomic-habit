One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is
to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every
day. If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider
working out to be a common habit. If you’re surrounded by `jazz` lovers,
you’re more likely to believe it’s reasonable to play jazz every day. Your
culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself
with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise
together.

To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy
one step further.
