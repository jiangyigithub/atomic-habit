Laszlo successfully `courted` Klara, and within a few years, the
Polgars were parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit.

Susan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old.
Within six months, she was `defeating` adults.

Sofia, the middle child, did even better. By fourteen, she was a
world champion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster.

Judit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat
her father. At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among
the top one hundred chess players in the world. At fifteen years and
four months old, she became the youngest grandmaster of all timeâ€”
younger than Bobby Fischer, the previous record holder. For twentyseven
years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess player in
the world.
