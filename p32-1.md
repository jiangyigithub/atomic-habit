How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and
`Vice Versa`)

WHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good
ones? Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life
than improving your daily habits. And yet it is likely that this time next
year you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better.

It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few
days, even with `sincere` effort and the `occasional burst` of motivation.
Habits like `exercise`, `meditation`, journaling, and cooking are
reasonable for a day or two and then become a `hassle`.

However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick
around forever—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best
intentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much
television, `procrastinating`, and smoking can feel impossible to break.

Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to
change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the
wrong way. In this chapter, I’ll address the first point. In the chapters
that follow, I’ll answer the second.

Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To
understand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which
change can `occur`. You can `imagine` them like the `layers` of an `onion`.
