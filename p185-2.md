All five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion,
for instance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise
in the nursing ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn
away. When the researchers tracked these children through life, they
found that the babies who turned toward the noise were more likely to
grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away were more likely to
become introverts.

People who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and
warm. They also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a
hormone that plays an important role in social bonding, increases
feelings of trust, and can act as a natural antidepressant. You can
easily imagine how someone with more oxytocin might be inclined to
build habits like writing thank-you notes or organizing social events.

As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality
trait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in
neuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait
has been linked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the
brain responsible for noticing threats. In other words, people who are
more sensitive to negative cues in their environment are more likely to
score high in neuroticism.
