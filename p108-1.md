The experiment always `began` the same. First, there would be some
easy trials where everyone agreed on the correct line. After a few
rounds, the participants were shown a test that was just as obvious as
the previous ones, except the actors in the room would select an
intentionally incorrect answer. For example, they would respond “A”
to the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree that the
lines were the same even though they were clearly different.

The subject, who was unaware of the `ruse`, would immediately
become `bewildered`. Their eyes would open wide. They would laugh
nervously to themselves. They would double-check the reactions of
other participants. Their `agitation` would grow as one person after
another delivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the subject
began to doubt their own eyes. Eventually, they delivered the answer
they knew in their heart to be incorrect.
