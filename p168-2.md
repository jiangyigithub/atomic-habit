In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind
you to act, (2) is `inherently` motivating because you see the progress
you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying
whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.
Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting
votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful
form of immediate and `intrinsic` gratification.*

You may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have I
waited so long to talk about it?

Despite all the benefits, I’ve left this discussion until now for a
simple reason: many people `resist` the idea of tracking and measuring.
It can feel like a burden because it forces you into two habits: the habit
you’re trying to build and the habit of tracking it. Counting calories
sounds like a `hassle` when you’re already struggling to follow a diet.
Writing down every sales call seems `tedious` when you’ve got work to
do. It feels easier to say, “I’ll just eat less.” Or, “I’ll try harder.” Or, “I’ll
remember to do it.” People `inevitably` tell me things like, “I have a
decision journal, but I wish I used it more.” Or, “I recorded my
workouts for a week, but then quit.” I’ve been there myself. I once
made a food log to track my calories. I managed to do it for one meal
and then gave up.
