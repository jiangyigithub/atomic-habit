Three deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat.

Eventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine
with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy.
Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to change
your emotional state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and
smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has
been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do with
the original situation.

The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to
reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you
can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into
an attractive one.
