Military veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings.
If your identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what
happens when your period of service ends? For many business owners,
their identity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the
founder.” If you have spent every waking moment working on your
business, how will you feel after you sell the company?

The key to `mitigating` these losses of identity is to redefine yourself
such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if
your particular role changes.

“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally
`tough` and loves a physical challenge.”

“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who
is disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”

“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds
and creates things.”
