How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

In 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an
experiment that would lay the foundation for our understanding of
how habits form and the rules that guide our behavior. Thorndike was
interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he `started` by
working with cats.

He would place each cat inside a device known as a `puzzle` box. The
box was designed so that the cat could `escape` through a door “by some
simple act, such as pulling at a loop of `cord`, pressing a `lever`, or
stepping on a platform.” For example, one box contained a lever that,
when pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door
had been opened, the cat could `dart out` and run over to a bowl of food.
