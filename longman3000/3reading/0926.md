Although I still hope `things will go differently`, the experts I’ve spoken to think we are likely to face a global `tragedy`—hundreds of thousands of deaths from Covid-19.

尽管我仍然希望事情会有所不同，但我与专家们的交流表明，我们可能会面临一场全球性的悲剧，数十万人可能会因Covid-19而丧生。

I hope that society views this as a warning for the future. Covid-19 is bad, but only a `warm-up`. I think it’s unlikely that this is the worst new pandemic (human-created `or otherwise`) we’ll see in our lifetimes. We need to be ready to deal with it much better next time.

我希望社会能把这看作是未来的一种警示。虽然Covid-19已经很严重，但它只是一个前奏。我认为这不太可能是我们一生中将会面对的最糟糕的新大流行病（无论是人为造成的还是其他原因）。我们需要更好地为下一次应对做好准备。

In the meantime, young healthy people should try to avoid getting Covid-19 for as long as possible. It’s true that it doesn’t seem to be very bad for young people, but more people getting it—particularly people who don’t get sick enough to stay home—will `accelerate the spread`, and this virus seems quite bad for old people and people with `pre-existing conditions`.

与此同时，年轻健康的人应尽量避免尽可能长时间地感染Covid-19。的确，对年轻人来说，似乎并不太糟糕，但更多的人感染，特别是那些没有病得足够重以至于需要留在家里的人，会加速传播，而这种病毒对老年人和有基础疾病的人似乎相当危险。

I expect society will shift to `a new normal` pretty fast. Some of these elements—e.g., much less business travel, much less handshaking, much more handwashing—I `expect to just stick`. Some others—e.g., people working from home all of the time—I expect to not stick.

我预计社会将迅速转向一个新的常态。其中一些元素，比如商务旅行大幅减少、握手减少、更多洗手，我预计将成为常态。而另一些元素，比如人们一直在家工作，我认为不会成为常态。

The economic `disruption` is still probably `under-appreciated` and will remind us that our systems are more `fragile` than we think. For example, I do not think the recent `plunge` in `US Treasury yields` is explained by Covid-19 alone, but rather a reminder of `cascading effects` that can happen in a complex system.

经济上的干扰可能仍然被低估，它将提醒我们，我们的体系比我们想象的更脆弱。例如，我认为最近美国国债收益率的暴跌并不仅仅是由Covid-19解释的，而是对一个复杂系统中可能发生的连锁效应的提醒。
