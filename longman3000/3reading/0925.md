A founder recently asked me how to stop caring what other people `think`. I didn’t have an answer, and after `reflecting on it more`, I think it's the wrong question.

最近有位创始人问我如何不在乎别人的看法。我没有答案，经过更深入的思考，我认为这个问题是错误的。

`Almost` everyone cares what someone thinks (though caring what everyone thinks is definitely a mistake), and it's probably important. Caring too much `makes you a sheep`. But you need to be at least a little `in tune with` others to do something useful for them.

几乎每个人都关心某人的看法（尽管关心每个人的看法肯定是错误的），这可能很重要。过于在意会让你变得像一只绵羊。但你至少需要对他人有一点共鸣，以便为他们做一些有用的事情。

It seems like there are two degrees of freedom: you can choose the people whose opinions you care about (and on what subjects), and you can choose the `timescale` you care about them on. Most people figure out the former [1] but the latter doesn’t seem to `get much attention`.

似乎有两个自由度：你可以选择关心哪些人的意见（以及关于什么主题的意见），你可以选择关心意见的时间尺度。大多数人会弄清楚前者，但似乎没有太多人关注后者。

The most impressive people I know care a lot about what people think, even people whose opinions they really shouldn’t `value` (a surprising numbers of them do something like keeping a folder of screenshots of tweets from haters). But what makes them unusual is that they generally care about other people’s opinions `on a very long time horizon`—as long as the history books get it right, they take some `pride` in letting the newspapers `get it wrong`.

我认识的最令人印象深刻的人非常关心别人的看法，即使是那些他们不应该重视的人的看法（令人惊讶的是，他们中的许多人会做一些像保存仇恨者的推文截图的事情）。但使他们与众不同的是，他们通常会关心其他人的长期看法——只要历史书写得正确，他们会因让报纸出错而感到自豪。

You should `trade` being short-term low-status `for` being long-term high-status, which most people seem unwilling to do. A common way this happens is by eventually being right about an important but deeply `non-consensus bet`. But there are lots of other ways–the `key observation` is that `as long as` you are right, being misunderstood by most people `is a strength not a weakness`. You and a small group of `rebels` get the space to solve an important problem that might otherwise not get solved.

你应该愿意牺牲短期的低地位，来换取长期的高地位，而大多数人似乎不愿意这样做。这通常的发生方式是最终在一个重要但非共识的赌注上获得正确判断。但还有很多其他方式——关键观点是，只要你是对的，被大多数人误解并不是一种弱点，而是一种优势。你和一小群反叛者有机会解决一个重要的问题，否则这个问题可能不会得到解决。
