Each evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—
that shapes the rest of my night. My wife walks in the door from work
and either we change into our workout clothes and head to the gym or
we `crash` onto the couch, order Indian food, and watch The Office.*
Similar to Twyla Tharp hailing the cab, the ritual is changing into my
workout clothes. If I change clothes, I know the workout will happen.

Everything that follows—driving to the gym, deciding which exercises
to do, stepping under the bar—is easy once I’ve taken the first step.
Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an `outsized`
impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments. The
moment you decide between ordering `takeout` or cooking dinner. The
moment you choose between driving your car or riding your bike. The
moment you decide between starting your homework or `grabbing` the
video game controller. These choices are a `fork in the road`.
