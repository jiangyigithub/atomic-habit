The modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has
`spawned`, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change:
Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more
likely it is to become habit-forming.

`Look around`. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of
reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors `evolved`
in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated `hips` and `breasts` to
sell clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few
minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn
splices together stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible
to replicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a combination
of `ideal lighting`, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even
the model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the
supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features
that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts `go wild` as a result,
driving us into `excessive` shopping habits, social media habits, porn
habits, eating habits, and many others.
