PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE

Oswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi. He is
also someone who understands the power of priming his environment.

Nuckols `dialed` in his cleaning habits by following a strategy he
refers to as “resetting the room.” For instance, when he finishes
watching television, he places the remote back on the TV stand,
arranges the `pillows` on the couch, and `folds the blanket`. When he
leaves his car, he throws any trash away. Whenever he `takes a shower`,
he wipes down the toilet while the shower is warming up. (As he notes,
the “perfect time to clean the toilet is right before you wash yourself in
the shower anyway.”) The purpose of resetting each room is not simply
to clean up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action.

“When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols
wrote. “Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in
good shape. . . . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy.
I’m just `proactively` lazy. It gives you so much time back.”
