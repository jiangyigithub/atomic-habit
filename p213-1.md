This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no
permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can
rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the
next bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy.
Make it satisfying. Round and round. Always looking for the next way
to get 1 percent better.

The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making
improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t
stop. It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop
working. It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop
training. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop
learning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop
saving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop
caring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound.

That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable
results.
