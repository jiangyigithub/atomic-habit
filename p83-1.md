Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at
your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it
easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn’t automatically
know where it is located in the store.

When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment,
redefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for
work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The `mantra` I find
useful is “One space, one use.”

When I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often work
from my couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very
difficult to stop working. There was no clear division between the end
of work time and the beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table
my office or the space where I ate meals? Was the couch where I
relaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the same
place.
