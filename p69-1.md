Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one
purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The
Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a
spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.

You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to
get new shoes and earrings to match. You buy a couch and suddenly
question the layout of your entire living room. You buy a toy for your
child and soon find yourself purchasing all of the accessories that go
with it. It’s a chain reaction of purchases.

Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to
do next based on what you have just finished doing. Going to the
bathroom leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you
that you need to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add
laundry detergent to the shopping list, and so on. No behavior
happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next
behavior.
