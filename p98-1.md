HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS MORE ATTRACTIVE

Ronan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland,
enjoyed watching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercise
more often than he did. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrne
hacked his stationary bike and connected it to his laptop and
television. Then he wrote a computer program that would allow Netflix
to run only if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for
too long, whatever show he was watching would `pause` until he started
`pedaling` again. He was, in the words of one fan, “eliminating `obesity`
one Netflix `binge` at a time.”

He was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercise
habit more attractive. Temptation bundling works by linking an action
you want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he
bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his
stationary bike (the thing he needed to do).

Businesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when
the American Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC,
launched its Thursday-night television `lineup` for the 2014–2015
season, they promoted temptation bundling on a `massive scale`.
