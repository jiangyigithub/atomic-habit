Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing
with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing.
It can be challenging to stick with habits like “no frivolous purchases”
or “no alcohol this month” because nothing happens when you skip
happy hour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel
satisfied when there is no action in the first place. All you’re doing is
resisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about that.

One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make
avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something
you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase,
put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning
latte? Transfer $5. Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over.
It’s like creating a loyalty program for yourself. The immediate reward
of seeing yourself save money toward the leather jacket feels a lot
better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.
