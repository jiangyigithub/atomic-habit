Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

ON THE FIRST day of class, Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the
University of Florida, divided his `film photography` students into
two groups.

Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be
in the “quantity” group. They would be `graded` `solely` on the amount of
work they produced. On the final day of class, he would `tally` the
number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos
would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.

Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the
“quality” group. They would be `graded` only on the excellence of their
work. They would only need to produce one photo during the
`semester`, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.

At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best
photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester,
these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with
`composition and lighting`, testing out various methods in the
darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating
hundreds of photos, they `honed` their skills. Meanwhile, the quality
group sat around `speculating` about perfection. In the end, they had
little to show for their efforts other than `unverified` theories and one
`mediocre` photo.*
