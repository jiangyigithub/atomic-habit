At the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy, which became
the `premier` training platform for organizations and individuals
interested in building better habits in life and work.* Fortune 500
companies and growing start-ups began to `enroll` their leaders and
train their staff. In total, over ten thousand leaders, managers,
coaches, and teachers have graduated from the Habits Academy, and
my work with them has taught me an incredible amount about what it
takes to make habits work in the real world.

As I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.com
is receiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundred
thousand people subscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number
that is so far beyond my expectations when I began that I’m not even
sure what to think of it.
