What’s the difference between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I
first learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert
comic. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are
about the processes that lead to those results.

If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your
system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant
coaches, and conduct practice.

If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-
dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire
employees, and run marketing campaigns.

If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your
system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle
difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from
your instructor.
