HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES

Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it.
They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we
know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of
opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The
better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.

Biological differences matter. Even so, itâ€™s more productive to focus
on whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing
yourself to someone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any
specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching the
ceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that they
have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to
them.
