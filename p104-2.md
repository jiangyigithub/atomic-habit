Most of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a
`burden`. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that
rewards you for your chess skills, playing chess will seem like a very
attractive thing to do. If you work in a job where everyone wears
expensive `suits`, then you’ll be `inclined` to `splurge` on one as well. If all
of your friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new phrase, you’ll
want to do it, too, so they know that you “get it.” Behaviors are
attractive when they help us fit in.

We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
1. The close.
2. The many.
3. The powerful.
