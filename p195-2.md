A flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully
`immersed` in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling.
They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4
percent beyond your current ability. In real life it’s typically not
`feasible` to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core
idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just
manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—
seems crucial for maintaining motivation.

Improvement requires a `delicate` balance. You need to regularly
search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to
make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain
novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without
variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest `villain` on
the quest for self-improvement.
