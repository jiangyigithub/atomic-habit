Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior
Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.
You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded
for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions
cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.

The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it
attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be
performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it
satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next
time. It completes the habit loop.

But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of
satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.
