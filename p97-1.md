Your brain has far more neural `circuitry` allocated for wanting
rewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are
large: the brain `stem`, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental
area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal
cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much
smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are
distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance,
researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is
activated during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure
is activated during liking.

The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the
regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of
the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives
behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that
precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.

These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior
Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the
expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the
first place. This is where a strategy known as `temptation bundling`
comes into play.
