Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take
advantage of good intentions before you can `fall victim to` temptation.
Whenever I’m looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the waiter
to split my meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If I
waited until the meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half,” it
would never work.

The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get
out of the good habit than to get started on it. If you’re feeling
motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of
time. If you’re excited about the business you want to start, email an
entrepreneur you respect and set up a consulting call. When the time
comes to act, the only way to bail is to cancel the meeting, which
requires effort and may cost money.

Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing
in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However,
we can do even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad
habits impossible.
