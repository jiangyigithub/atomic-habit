Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs
around Los Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was short. He
was rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of the people in
the crowd were too busy drinking or talking with friends to pay
attention. One night, he literally delivered his stand-up routine to an
empty club.

It wasnâ€™t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting
better. His first routines would only last one or two minutes. By high
school, his material had expanded to include a five-minute act and, a
few years later, a ten-minute show. At nineteen, he was performing
weekly for twenty minutes at a time. He had to read three `poems`
during the show just to make the routine long enough, but his skills
continued to progress.
