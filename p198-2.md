Chapter Summary

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak
motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of
their current abilities.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.

As habits `become routine`, they become less interesting and less
satisfying. We get bored.

Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to
keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.

Professionals stick to the schedule; `amateurs` let life get in the
way.
