Jerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak
of writing jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his
goal is simply to “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. In
other words, he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is
or how inspired he feels. He is simply focused on `showing up` and
adding to his streak.

“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful `mantra`. Don’t break the chain
of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t
break the chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect.
Don’t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with
an impressive portfolio. Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages
multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a
behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.
