The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue,
craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change
that evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background 
may recognize some of these terms from `operant conditioning`, which 
was first proposed as "stimulus, response, reward" by B. F. Skinner in 
the 1930s and has been popularized more recently as "cue, routine, 
reward" in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.

Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the
right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain
way. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how
external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for
how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal
states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades,
scientists have begun to determine the connection between our
thoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in
these pages.
