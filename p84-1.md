You may be thinking, “You don’t understand. I live in New York
City. My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to
play multiple roles.” Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide your
room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table
for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a
writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for
reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit
should have a home.

If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will
become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits
thrive under predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes
automatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is
easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes
quickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If you
want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an
environment that is stable and predictable.
A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is
an environment where habits can easily form.
