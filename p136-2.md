Whenever possible, I leave my phone in a different room until
lunch. When it’s right next to me, I’ll check it all morning for no
reason at all. But when it is in another room, I rarely think about it.
And the friction is high enough that I won’t go get it without a reason.
As a result, I get three to four hours each morning when I can work
without interruption.

If sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like enough,
tell a friend or family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask
a coworker to keep it at their desk in the morning and give it back to
you at lunch.

It is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwanted
behavior. When I hide beer in the back of the fridge where I can’t see
it, I drink less. When I delete social media apps from my phone, it can
be weeks before I download them again and log in. These tricks are
unlikely to curb a true addiction, but for many of us, a little bit of
friction can be the difference between sticking with a good habit or
sliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative impact of making
dozens of these changes and living in an environment designed to
make the good behaviors easier and the bad behaviors harder.
