Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a
parent, a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same
question: “How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s
right?” Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the
actions that are easiest to do.

Chapter Summary

Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will
naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least
amount of work.

possible.

is low, habits are easy.

Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction
is high, habits are difficult.
