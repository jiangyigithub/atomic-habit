If you’re still having trouble `determining` how to rate a particular
habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me
become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit `cast a vote` for
or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired
identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired
identity are usually bad.

As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change
anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on.
Observe your `thoughts` and actions without judgment or internal
`criticism`. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself
for your successes.

If you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as
if you were watching someone else. Oh, how interesting that they
would do such a thing. If you binge-eat, simply notice that you are
eating more `calories` than you should. If you waste time online, notice
that you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to.
