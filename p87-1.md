This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you
understand what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit
that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the
relevant situation arises. When Patty Olwell, a `therapist` from Austin,
Texas, started smoking, she would often light up while riding horses
with a friend. Eventually, she quit smoking and avoided it for years.
She had also stopped riding. Decades later, she `hopped` on a horse
again and found herself `craving` a cigarette for the first time in forever.
The cues were still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them
in a long time.

Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the
environmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior change
techniques can backfire. Shaming `obese` people with weight-loss
presentations can make them feel stressed, and as a result many
people return to their favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showing
pictures of `blackened` lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of
anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. If you’re
not careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to
stop.
