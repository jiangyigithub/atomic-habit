HOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS

Your genes are operating `beneath` the surface of every habit. Indeed,
beneath the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to
influence everything from the number of hours you spend watching
television to your likelihood to marry or `divorce` to your tendency to
get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or `nicotine`. There’s a strong `genetic`
component to how `obedient` or `rebellious` you are when facing
authority, how `vulnerable` or `resistant` you are to stressful events, how
`proactive` or `reactive` you tend to be, and even how `captivated` or bored
you feel during `sensory` experiences like attending a concert. As Robert
Plomin, a behavioral geneticist at King’s College in London, told me,
“It is now at the point where we have stopped testing to see if `traits`
have a `genetic` component because we literally can’t find a single one
that isn’t influenced by our genes.”
