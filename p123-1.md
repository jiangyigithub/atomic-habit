It is easy to `get bogged down` trying to find the optimal plan for
change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build
muscle, the perfect idea for a `side hustle`. We are so focused on
figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking
action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the `enemy` of the good.”

I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking
action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When
you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those
are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.

Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an
outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s
motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I
search for a better `diet` plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s
motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.
