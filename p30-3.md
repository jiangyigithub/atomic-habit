Chapter Summary

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1
percent better every day `counts for` a lot in the long-run.

Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or
against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.

Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross
a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any
compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just
as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are
the building blocks of remarkable results.

If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus
on your system instead.

You do not `rise` to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of
your systems.

章节总结

习惯是个人成长的复利效应。长期来说，每天进步1%的差距是非常大的。

习惯是一把双刃剑。它们可以为你服务，也可以反对你，这就是为什么理解细节至关重要。

小的变化在跨越关键阈值之前通常似乎没有任何区别。任何复利过程最强大的结果都是延迟出现的。你需要有耐心。

原子习惯是更大体系中的小习惯。就像原子是分子的构建块一样，原子习惯是卓越成果的基石。

如果你想要更好的结果，那就不要设定目标，而是专注于你的体系。

你不会升至目标的高度，而是下降至你的体系水平。
