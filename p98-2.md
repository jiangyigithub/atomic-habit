Every Thursday, the company would `air three shows` created by
screenwriter Shonda Rhimes—Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to
Get Away with Murder. They `branded it as` “TGIT on ABC” (TGIT
stands for Thank God It’s Thursday). In addition to promoting the
shows, ABC encouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and
enjoy the evening.

Andrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea
behind the campaign: “We see Thursday night as a `viewership`
opportunity, with either couples or women by themselves who want to
sit down and escape and have fun and drink their red wine and have
some popcorn.” The `brilliance` of this strategy is that ABC was
associating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their shows)
with activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine,
and eat popcorn).

Over time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling
relaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8
p.m. every Thursday, then eventually “8 p.m. on Thursday” means
`relaxation` and entertainment. The reward gets associated with the cue,
and the habit of turning on the television becomes more attractive.
