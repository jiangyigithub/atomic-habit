The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you
want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then
adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their `odds`.

We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that
makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this
`predicament` is to increase the speed of the punishment associated
with the behavior. There can’t be a gap between the action and the
consequences.

As soon as actions `incur` an immediate consequence, behavior
begins to change. Customers pay their bills on time when they are
charged `a late fee`. Students show up to class when their grade is linked
to `attendance`. We’ll jump through a lot of `hoops` to avoid a little bit of
immediate pain.
