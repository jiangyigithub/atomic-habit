Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to
let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale
doesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family,
they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until
tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision
is easy to `dismiss`.

But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating
poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little
excuses, our small choices compound into `toxic` results. It’s the
accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—
that eventually leads to a problem.

The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect
of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you
are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from
LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in
Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely
noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—
but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up
hundreds of miles apart.

遗憾的是，缓慢的转变速度也使得我们容易放任不良习惯。如果你今天吃了一顿不健康的饭食，体重几乎没有变化。如果你今晚加班而忽视了家人，他们会原谅你。如果你拖延并将项目推迟到明天，通常还有时间后来完成。一个决定很容易被忽视。

但是，当我们一次又一次地重复1%的错误，通过复制糟糕的决策、重复微小的错误和为自己找借口来合理化时，我们的小小选择会累积成有害的结果。是许多错误的积累——这里和那里的1%的下降——最终导致问题的出现。

习惯改变所产生的影响，就像调整飞机航线方向几度一样。想象一下你从洛杉矶飞往纽约。如果从洛杉矶国际机场起飞的飞行员将航向调整偏南3.5度，你将降落在华盛顿特区，而不是纽约。这样微小的改变在起飞时几乎不会被注意到——飞机的机头只移动了几英尺——但在整个美国范围内放大，你最终相距数百英里。
