I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When
asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not
confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my
wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.”
This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each
day. 

`Reframing` your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their
drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and
make a habit seem more attractive.

Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging
task that `drains` energy and wears you down. You can just as easily
view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling
yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build
`endurance` and get fast.”
