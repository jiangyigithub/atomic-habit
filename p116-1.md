These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically
describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions
transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a
signal that we can apply. They help explain what we are currently
sensing. For instance, whether or not you realize it, you are noticing
how warm or cold you feel right now. If the temperature drops by one
degree, you probably won’t do anything. If the temperature drops ten
degrees, however, you’ll feel cold and put on another layer of clothing.
Feeling cold was the signal that prompted you to act. You have been
sensing the cues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that
you would be `better off` in a different state that you take action.

A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to
change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap
between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be
sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state
provides a reason to act.
