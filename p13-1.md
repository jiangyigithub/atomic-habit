In 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and
signed a book deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the
book you are reading now. As my audience grew, so did my business
opportunities. I was increasingly asked to speak at top companies
about the science of habit formation, behavior change, and continuous
improvement. I found myself delivering keynote speeches at
conferences in the United States and Europe.

In 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publications
like Time, Entrepreneur, and Forbes. Incredibly, my writing was read
by over eight million people that year. Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and
MLB began reading my work and sharing it with their teams.
