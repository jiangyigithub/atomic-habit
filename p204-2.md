Magic’s CBE number here would be 879. This number was
calculated for all of a player’s games, and it was the average CBE that a
player was asked to improve by 1 percent over the season. Riley
compared each player’s current CBE to not only their past
performances but also those of other players in the league. As Riley
put it, “We rank team members alongside league opponents who play
the same position and have similar role definitions.”

Sportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top
performers in the league in `bold lettering` on the blackboard each week
and measured them against the corresponding players on his own
roster. Solid, reliable players generally rated a score in the 600s, while
elite players scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted 138
triple-doubles in his career, often scored over 1,000.”
