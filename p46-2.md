As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases.
You learn to lock in on the `cues` that predict success and tune out
everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you
know exactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze
every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and
error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive
scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is
appropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the `itch` to run.
As soon as you walk in the door from work, you `grab` the video game
controller. A choice that once required effort is now automatic. A habit
has been created.

Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a
habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a
problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw
on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The
primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what
will work in the future.

Habit formation is `incredibly` useful because the conscious mind is
the `bottleneck` of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at
a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your
conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever
possible, the conscious mind likes to `pawn off` tasks to the
nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what
happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free
up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
