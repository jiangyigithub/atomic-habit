Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack
is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some
people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make
an improvement.

Once an implementation intention has been set, you donâ€™t have to
wait for inspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I
meditate this morning or at lunch? When the moment of action
occurs, there is no need.

The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill
out this sentence:
I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my
kitchen.

Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my
bedroom.

Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.

Marriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the
kitchen.
