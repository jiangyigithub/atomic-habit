I had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the book afterward
out of `curiosity`. The author employs an interesting strategy to help
smokers eliminate their cravings. He systematically reframes each cue
associated with smoking and gives it a new meaning.

He says things like:

You think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting
anything because cigarettes do nothing for you.

You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but
it’s not. You can be social without smoking at all.

You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking
does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.
