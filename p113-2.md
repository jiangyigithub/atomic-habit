Over and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get
it clearly into your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are
making marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money
but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of
all, in the length and quality of your future life.”

By the time you get to the end of the book, smoking seems like the
most ridiculous thing in the world to do. And if you no longer expect
smoking to bring you any benefits, you have no reason to smoke. It is
an inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: make it unattractive.
Now, I know this idea might sound `overly` simplistic. Just change your
mind and you can quit smoking. But stick with me for a minute.

WHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM

Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying
motive. I often have a craving that goes something like this: “I want to
eat `tacos`.” If you were to ask me why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t
say, “Because I need food to survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep
down, I am motivated to eat tacos because I have to eat to survive. The
underlying motive is to obtain food and water even if my specific
craving is for a taco.
