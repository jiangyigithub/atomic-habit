Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency.
That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across
time.* You value the present more than the future. Usually, this
tendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typically
worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But
occasionally, our bias toward `instant gratification` causes problems.

Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of
lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases
their risk of `obesity`? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know
it can result in sexually transmitted disease? Once you understand
how the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the
consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are
immediate. Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it reduces stress
and eases your nicotine cravings now. Overeating is harmful in the
long run but `appetizing` in the moment. Sex—safe or not—provides
pleasure right away. Disease and infection won’t show up for days or
weeks, even years.
