`Look around`. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of
reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors `evolved`
in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated `hips` and `breasts` to
sell clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few
minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn
splices together stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible
to replicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a combination
of `ideal lighting`, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even
the model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the
supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features
that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts `go wild` as a result,
driving us into `excessive` shopping habits, social media habits, porn
habits, eating habits, and many others.

If history `serves as` a guide, the opportunities of the future will be
more attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to
become more `concentrated` and stimuli to become more `enticing`. Junk
food is a more concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard
liquor is a more concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games
are a more concentrated form of play than `board games`. Compared to
nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have
the brains of our `ancestors` but temptations they never had to face.
If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you
need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law,
our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not
possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can
make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by
understanding what a craving is and how it works.
We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—
the dopamine spike.

In the long history of
humankind, those who learned to `collaborate` and `improvise` most
effectively have `prevailed`.
