How to Make a Habit `Irresistible`

IN THE 1940S, a Dutch scientist named Niko Tinbergen performed a
series of experiments that transformed our understanding of what
motivates us. Tinbergen—who eventually won a Nobel Prize for his
work—was investigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds often
seen flying along the `seashores` of North America.

Adult herring gulls have a small red dot on their `beak`, and
Tinbergen noticed that `newly hatched` chicks would `peck` this spot
whenever they wanted food. To begin one experiment, he created a
collection of fake cardboard beaks, just a head without a body. When
the parents had `flown away`, he went over to the `nest` and offered these
`dummy` beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes, and he
assumed the baby birds would reject them `altogether`.
