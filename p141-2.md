You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-
minute version:
“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”
“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”
“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”
“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”
“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”

The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone
can meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of
clothing away. And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful
strategy because once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much
easier to continue doing it. A new habit should not feel like a
challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two
minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that
naturally leads you down a more productive path.
