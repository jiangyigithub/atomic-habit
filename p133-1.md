One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with
your habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we
discussed environment design as a method for making cues more
obvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actions
easier. For example, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is
best to choose a place that is already along the path of your daily
routine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your
life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work
because stopping doesn’t add much friction to your lifestyle. By
comparison, if the gym is off the path of your normal `commute—even`
by just a few blocks—now you’re going “out of your way” to get there.

Perhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your
home or office. Too often, we try to start habits in high-friction
environments. We try to follow a strict diet while we are out to dinner
with friends. We try to write a book in a `chaotic` household. We try to
concentrate while using a smartphone filled with distractions. It
doesn’t have to be this way. We can remove the points of friction that
hold us back. This is precisely what electronics manufacturers in
Japan began to do in the 1970s.
