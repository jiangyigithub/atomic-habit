If history `serves as` a guide, the opportunities of the future will be
more attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to
become more `concentrated` and stimuli to become more `enticing`. Junk
food is a more concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard
liquor is a more concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games
are a more concentrated form of play than `board games`. Compared to
nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have
the brains of our `ancestors` but temptations they never had to face.
If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you
need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law,
our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not
possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can
make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by
understanding what a craving is and how it works.
We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits shareâ€”
the dopamine spike.
