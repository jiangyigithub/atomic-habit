I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in
which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they
made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their
choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were
correct and where they went wrong.*

Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about finetuning
them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time
on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary—
like Pat Riley adjusting the effort of his players on a nightly basis. You
don’t want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective.

Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review.
Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the
previous year. I `tally` my habits for the year by counting up how many
articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new
places I visited, and more.* Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack
thereof) by answering three questions:

1. What went well this year?
2. What didn’t go so well this year?
3. What did I learn?
