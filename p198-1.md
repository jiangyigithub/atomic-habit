I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking
to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a
business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. When
you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing.
When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like
typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or `draining` to do
so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an
`amateur`.

Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with
purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.

David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his
students to avoid being “`fair-weather` meditators.” Similarly, you don’t
want to be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fairweather
anything. When a habit is truly important to you, you have to
be willing to stick to it in any `mood`. Professionals take action even
when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way
to put the `reps` in.

There have been a lot of sets that I haven’t felt like finishing, but
I’ve never `regretted` doing the workout. There have been a lot of
articles I haven’t felt like writing, but I’ve never regretted publishing
on schedule. There have been a lot of days I’ve felt like relaxing, but
I’ve never regretted showing up and working on something that was
important to me.

The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly `fascinated` by
doing the same thing `over and over`. You have to fall in love with
boredom.
