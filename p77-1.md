People often choose products not because of what they are, but
because of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of
cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even
if I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily
feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with
doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to grab one every now
and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and
the cues in front of you.

Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.
Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again
and again under certain environmental conditions. In church, people
tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and
guarded. In this way, the most common form of change is not internal,
but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is
context dependent.
