The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

THE FATE OF British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The
organization, which was the governing body for professional
cycling in Great `Britain`, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new
performance director. At the time, professional cyclists in Great
Britain had `endured` nearly one hundred years of `mediocrity`. Since
1908, British riders had `won` just a single gold medal at the Olympic
Games, and they had `fared even worse` in cycling’s biggest race, the
Tour de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.

In fact, the performance of British riders had been so
`underwhelming` that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe
refused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would
hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear.

Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory.
What made him different from `previous` coaches was his `relentless`
commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the `aggregation` of
marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny
margin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “The
whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything
you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1
percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all
together.”

《微习惯的惊人力量》

2003年的一天，英国自行车界的命运发生了改变。作为英国职业自行车的管理机构，该组织最近聘请了戴夫·布雷尔斯福德担任新的绩效总监。当时，英国职业自行车选手在近百年的时间里一直饱受平庸之苦。自1908年以来，英国选手在奥林匹克运动会上仅获得了一枚金牌，而在自行车最重要的比赛——环法自行车赛中表现更为糟糕。110年来，没有一位英国自行车选手曾赢得过这个赛事。

事实上，英国选手的表现如此平平淡淡，以至于欧洲一家顶级自行车制造商拒绝向该队销售自行车，因为他们担心其他专业选手看到英国选手使用他们的装备会影响销售。

布雷尔斯福德被聘请来开创英国自行车的新轨迹。与之前的教练不同的是，他对一种被他称为“边际收益的积聚”的策略有着坚定不移的承诺，即在你所做的一切中寻求微小的改进。布雷尔斯福德说：“整个原则源于这样一个想法，即如果你将骑自行车所需要的一切因素分解开来，然后将其各自提高1％，当你将它们整合在一起时，你将获得显著的提高。”
