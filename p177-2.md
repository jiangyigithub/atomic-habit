And then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan doesn’t do
these two items then the following consequence `will be enforced`: He
will have to dress up each workday and each Sunday morning for the
rest of the quarter. Dress up is defined as not wearing jeans, t-shirts,
hoodies, or shorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as
he sees fit if he misses one day of logging food.”

At the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all signed
the contract.

My initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly
formal and unnecessary, especially the signatures. But Harris
convinced me that signing the contract was an indication of
seriousness. “Anytime I skip this part,” he said, “I start `slacking` almost
immediately.”

Three months later, after hitting his targets for Q1, Harris upgraded
his goals. The consequences `escalated`, too. If he missed his
carbohydrate and protein targets, he had to pay his trainer $100. And
if he failed to weigh himself, he had to give his wife $500 to use as she
saw fit. Perhaps most painfully, if he forgot to run sprints, he had to
dress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the rest of the
quarter—`the bitter rival` of his `beloved` Auburn team.
