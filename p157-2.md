Tasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of
immediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use.
Consumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the largest chewing
gum company in the world.

Toothpaste had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed great
success when they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and
cinnamon to their products. These flavors don’t improve the
effectiveness of toothpaste. They simply create a “clean mouth” feel
and make the experience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My
wife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didn’t like the
aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint flavor, which
proved to be more satisfying.

Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason
to repeat it. In my research, I `came across` the story of a woman who
had a `narcissistic relative` who `drove` her nuts. `In an attempt to` spend
less time with this `egomaniac`, she acted as `dull` and as boring as
possible whenever he `was around`. Within a few `encounters`, he started
avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting.
