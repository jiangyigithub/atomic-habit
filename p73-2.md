One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by
brainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your Habits
Scorecard from the last chapter as a starting point. Alternatively, you
can create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down the
habits you do each day without fail.*

For example:

Get out of bed.
Take a shower.
Brush your teeth.
Get dressed.
Brew a cup of coffee.
Eat breakfast.
Take the kids to school.
Start the work day.
Eat lunch.
End the work day.
Change out of work clothes.
Sit down for dinner.
Turn off the lights.
Get into bed.
