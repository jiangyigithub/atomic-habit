Chapter Summary

The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive
to us.

We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our
culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the
tribe.

We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close
(family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful
(those with status and prestige).

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits
is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal
behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the
group.

The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired
behavior of the individual. Most days, weâ€™d rather be wrong with
the crowd than be right by ourselves.

If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it
attractive.
