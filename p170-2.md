The first mistake is never the one that `ruins` you. It is the `spiral` of
repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing
twice is the start of a new habit.

This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone
can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But
when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a
habit doesn’t matter if the `reclaiming` of it is fast.

I think this principle is so important that I’ll `stick to` it even if I can’t
do a habit as well or as completely as I would like. Too often, we fall
into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not
`slipping up`; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something
perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.

You don’t realize how valuable it is to just `show up` on your bad (or
busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If
you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But
you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other
words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just `as valuable as` achieving a 50
percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding:
Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”
