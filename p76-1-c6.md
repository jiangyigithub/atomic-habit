Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

ANNE THORNDIKE, A primary care `physician` at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improve
the eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors without
changing their `willpower` or motivation in the `slightest` way. In fact,
she didn’t plan on talking to them at all.

Thorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter
the “choice architecture” of the hospital `cafeteria`. They started by
changing how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the
`refrigerators` located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria were
filled with only soda. The researchers added water as an option to each
one. Additionally, they placed baskets of bottled water next to the food
stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary
refrigerators, but water was now available at all drink locations.

Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the
hospital dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water
increased by 25.8 percent. They made similar adjustments—and saw
similar results—with the food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word
to anyone eating there.
