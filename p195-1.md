Martin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the Goldilocks
Rule in practice. Each year, he `expanded` his comedy routine—but only
by a minute or two. He was always adding new material, but he also
kept a few jokes that were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just
enough victories to keep him motivated and just enough mistakes to
keep him working hard.

When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the
behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when
conditions aren’t perfect. This is an idea we covered in detail while
discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.

Once a habit has been established, however, it’s important to
continue to advance in small ways. These little improvements and new
challenges `keep you engaged`. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just
right, you can achieve a flow state.*
