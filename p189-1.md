What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore
what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you.
Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask,
“What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I
felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing.
No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement
and enjoyment. Whenever you feel `authentic` and `genuine`, you
are headed in the right direction.

To be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and
Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities
that are highly valued by society and to be placed in the ideal
environment for those abilities. We all have limited time on this
planet, and the truly great among us are the ones who not only work
hard but also have the good `fortune` to `be exposed to` opportunities
that `favor` us.
