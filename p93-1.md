Other `processed foods` enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to
items with a combination of sensations, like `crunchy and creamy`.
Imagine the gooeyness of melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust,
or the crunch of an Oreo cookie combined with its smooth center.
With natural, unprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same
sensations over and over—how’s that seventeenth bite of kale taste?
After a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel full.
But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience `novel`
and interesting, encouraging you to eat more.

`Ultimately`, such strategies enable food scientists to find the “bliss
point” for each product—the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat
that excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more. The
result, of course, is that you overeat because `hyperpalatable` foods are
more attractive to the human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a
neuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and `obesity`, says,
“We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”
