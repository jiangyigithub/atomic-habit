HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS

The French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in
poverty, but that all changed one day in 1765.

Diderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could not afford
to pay for the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well
known for his role as the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, one
of the most comprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine
the Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s financial troubles,
her heart went out to him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed
his encyclopedia. She offered to buy Diderot’s personal library for
£1,000—more than $150,000 today.* Suddenly, Diderot had money to
spare. With his new wealth, he not only paid for the wedding but also
acquired a scarlet robe for himself.

Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he
immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by
his more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more
coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant
robe and the rest of his stuff.

Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced
his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with
expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel,
and a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a
leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.
