The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is
concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a
book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are
associated with this level of change.

The second layer is changing your process. This level is
concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a
new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow,
developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are
associated with this level.

The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This
level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your
self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the
beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this
level.

Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do.
Identity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habits
that last—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent

improvements—the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse”
than another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. The
problem is the direction of change.

Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing
on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits.
The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach,
we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
