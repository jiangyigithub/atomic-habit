My Story

ON THE FINAL day of my `sophomore` year of high school, I was hit in
the face with a baseball bat. As my classmate took a `full swing`, the
bat slipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking
me directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of
`impact`.

The bat `smashed` into my face with such force that it crushed my
nose into a `distorted` U-shape. The collision sent the soft `tissue` of my
brain `slamming` into the inside of my `skull`. Immediately, a wave of
`swelling` `surged throughout` my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a
broken nose, multiple skull fractures, and two shattered eye sockets.

When I opened my eyes, I saw people `staring at` me and running
over to help. I looked down and noticed `spots` of red on my clothes.
One of my classmates took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I
used it to plug the stream of blood rushing from my broken nose.
Shocked and confused, I was unaware of how seriously I had been
injured.
