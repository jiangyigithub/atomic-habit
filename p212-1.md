Over the course of this book, we’ve looked at dozens of stories about
top performers. We’ve heard about Olympic gold medalists, awardwinning
artists, business leaders, lifesaving physicians, and star
comedians who have all used the science of small habits to master
their craft and `vault` to the top of their field. Each of the people, teams,
and companies we have covered has faced different circumstances, but
ultimately progressed in the same way: through a commitment to tiny,
sustainable, `unrelenting` improvements.

Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system
to improve, an endless process to refine. In Chapter 1, I said, “If you’re
having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The
problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again
not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong
system for change.”
