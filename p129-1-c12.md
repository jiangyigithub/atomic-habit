The Law of Least Effort

IN THIS AWARD-WINNING BOOK, Guns, Germs, and Steel, anthropologist
and biologist Jared Diamond points out a simple fact: different
continents have different shapes. At first glance, this statement seems
rather obvious and unimportant, but it turns out to have a profound
impact on human behavior.

The primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is,
the landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin
rather than wide and fat. The same is generally true for Africa.
Meanwhile, the landmass that makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle
East is the opposite. This massive stretch of land tends to be more
east-west in shape. According to Diamond, this difference in shape
played a significant role in the spread of agriculture over the centuries.

When agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had an
easier time expanding along east-west routes than along north-south
ones. This is because locations along the same latitude generally share
similar climates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in
season. These factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia to
domesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire stretch of land
from France to China.
