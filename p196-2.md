His answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking
about work `ethic`. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on
their goals. Whether it’s business or sports or art, you hear people say
things like, “It all comes down to passion.” Or, “You have to really
want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or
motivation because we think that successful people have some
bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that really
successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else.
The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the
feelings of boredom.

`Mastery` requires practice. But the more you practice something, the
more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have
been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade.
Sometimes it happens even faster than that. All you have to do is hit
the gym a few days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time
and letting one day `slip` doesn’t feel like much. Things are going well.
It’s easy to rationalize taking a day off because you’re in a good place.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get
bored with habits because they stop `delighting` us. The outcome
becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start
`derailing` our progress to seek `novelty`. Perhaps this is why we get
caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the
next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we
experience the `slightest` `dip` in motivation, we begin seeking a new
strategy—even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted,
“Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well
wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”
