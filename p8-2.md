I was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the
helipad across the street. The stretcher `rattled` on a bumpy sidewalk as
one nurse pushed me along while another pumped each breath into
me by hand. My mother, who had arrived at the hospital a few
moments before, climbed into the helicopter beside me. I remained
unconscious and unable to breathe on my own as she held my hand
during the flight.

While my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my father went
home to `check on` my brother and sister and break the news to them.
He choked back tears as he explained to my sister that he would miss
her eighth-grade graduation ceremony that night. After passing my
siblings off to family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my
mother.

When my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of
nearly twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and
wheeled me into the trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my
brain had become so severe that I was having repeated post-traumatic
seizures. My broken bones needed to be fixed, but I was in no
condition to `undergo surgery`. After yet another `seizure`—my third of
the day—I was put into a medically induced `coma` and placed on a
ventilator.
