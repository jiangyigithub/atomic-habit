The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success
and failure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time
you don’t. You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction
and just enough “wanting” to experience desire. This is one of the
benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested
in a habit, working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a
good way to keep things interesting.

Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you
wouldn’t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result
some of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If
Uber only picked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service
much longer. And if I flossed my teeth each night and only sometimes
ended up with a clean mouth, I think I’d skip it.

Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At
some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of selfimprovement:
you have to fall in love with boredom.

We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we
would like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to
become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or
exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable
results.
