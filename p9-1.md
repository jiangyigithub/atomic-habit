My parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier,
they had entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister
was diagnosed with leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My
brother was just six months old. After two and a half years of
chemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone marrow biopsies, my
little sister finally walked out of the hospital happy, healthy, and
cancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents found
themselves back in the same place with a different child.

While I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a `priest` and a social
worker to comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met
with them a decade earlier on the evening they found out my sister had
cancer.

As day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My
parents slept restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they
would collapse from fatigue, the next they would be wide awake with
worry. My mother would tell me later, “It was one of the worst nights
I’ve ever had.”
