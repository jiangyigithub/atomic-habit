HOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR

Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for
maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can
enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the
things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular
area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for
doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making
progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with
better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them
happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work.
Itâ€™s a virtuous cycle.
