Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular
neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply
`putting in` your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to

All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to
automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is

which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.

It looks something like this:
