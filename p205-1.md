The Lakers also emphasized `year-over-year` progress by making
historical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “We stacked the month
of November 1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players
whether they were doing better or worse than at the same point last
season. Then we showed them how their performance figures for
December 1986, stacked up against November’s.”

The Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later,
they were NBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team
to another title as the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to
win back-to-back NBA championships. Afterward, he said, “Sustaining
an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be
successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same
way every time.”

The CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection and
review. The Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the
most out of what they had, and made sure their habits improved
rather than declined.
