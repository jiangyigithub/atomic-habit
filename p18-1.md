Brailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you
might expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the
bike seats to make them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the
tires for a better grip. They asked riders to wear electrically heated
overshorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and
used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each athlete responded to a
particular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel
and had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which
proved to be lighter and more aerodynamic.

But they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find
1 percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They
tested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the
fastest muscle recovery. They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the
best way to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold.
They determined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best
night’s sleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team
truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would
normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the
finely tuned bikes.
