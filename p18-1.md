Brailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you
might expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the
bike seats to make them more comfortable and `rubbed` alcohol on the
tires for a better `grip`. They asked riders to wear electrically heated
overshorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and
used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each athlete responded to a
particular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel
and had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which
proved to be lighter and more `aerodynamic`.

But they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find
1 percent improvements in `overlooked` and unexpected areas. They
tested different types of massage `gels` to see which one led to the
fastest muscle recovery. They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the
best way to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold.
They determined the type of `pillow` and `mattress` that led to the best
night’s sleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team
truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would
normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the
finely tuned bikes.

布雷尔斯福德和他的教练们开始对一支职业自行车队来说是常见的进行小调整。他们重新设计了自行车座椅，使其更加舒适，并在轮胎上涂抹酒精以增加抓地力。他们要求骑手穿着电热裤子，以保持骑行时肌肉的理想温度，并使用生物反馈传感器监测每个运动员对特定训练的反应。团队在风洞中测试了各种面料，并让户外骑手换上室内赛服，这种赛服更轻、更具空气动力学性能。

但他们并没有止步于此。布雷尔斯福德和他的团队继续在被忽视和意想不到的领域寻找1％的改进。他们测试了不同类型的按摩凝胶，以确定哪种凝胶能够最快地恢复肌肉。他们聘请了一位外科医生，教导每位骑手正确洗手的最佳方式，以减少感冒的几率。他们确定了每位骑手所需的最佳枕头和床垫类型，以获得良好的睡眠质量。他们甚至将车队卡车的内部涂成白色，这有助于他们发现通常会被忽略的细小灰尘，这些灰尘可能会降低精确调校的自行车的性能。
