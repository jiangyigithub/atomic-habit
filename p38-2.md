THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY

Your identity `emerges out of` your habits. You are not born with `preset`
beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and
conditioned through experience.*

More `precisely`, your habits are how you `embody` your identity.
When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an
organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity
of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the
identity of an `athletic` person.
