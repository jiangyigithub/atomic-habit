This brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and
worldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they
come from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed?
And how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that `serve`
you and `gradually` `erase` the pieces that `hinder` you?

THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY

Your identity `emerges out of` your habits. You are not born with `preset`
beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and
conditioned through experience.*

More `precisely`, your habits are how you `embody` your identity.
When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an
organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity
of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the
identity of an `athletic` person.
