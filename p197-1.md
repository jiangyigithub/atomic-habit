Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are
those that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide
visual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide
culinary novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements of
surprise.

In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.* Slot machines
are the most common real-world example. A `gambler` hits the jackpot
every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of
rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine,
enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.

Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a
reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable
interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful
way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce
boredom.
