By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are
running our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the fact
that we tie the same shoe first each morning, or unplug the toaster
after each use, or always change into comfortable clothes after getting
home from work. After decades of mental programming, we
automatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.

THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE

In the following chapters, we will see time and again how the four
stages of cue, craving, response, and reward influence nearly
everything we do each day. But before we do that, we need to
transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use
to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.

I refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change,
and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and
breaking bad ones. You can think of each law as a lever that influences
human behavior. When the levers are in the right positions, creating
good habits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is
nearly impossible.
