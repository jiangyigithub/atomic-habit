Habits are all about associations. These associations determine
whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered
in our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing
information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you
perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction
about what to do in the next moment.

Cue: You notice that the `stove` is hot.
Prediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.

Cue: You see that the traffic light turned green.
Prediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the
intersection and get closer to my destination, so I should step on the
gas.
