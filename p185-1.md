Bundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose
you to a particular personality. Your personality is the set of
characteristics that is consistent from situation to situation. The most
proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big
Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.

1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end
to cautious and consistent on the other.

2. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and
spontaneous.

3. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved
(you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).

4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and
detached.

5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and
stable.
