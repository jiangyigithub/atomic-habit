THE MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED REWARDS

Imagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of Africa—a giraffe or an
elephant or a lion. On any given day, most of your decisions have an
immediate impact. You are always thinking about what to eat or where
to sleep or how to avoid a predator. You are constantly focused on the
present or the very near future. You live in what scientists call an
immediate-return environment because your actions instantly deliver
clear and immediate outcomes.

Now switch back to your human self. In modern society, many of
the choices you make today will not benefit you immediately. If you do
a good job at work, you’ll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise
today, perhaps you won’t be overweight next year. If you save money
now, maybe you’ll have enough for retirement decades from now. You
live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you
can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.

The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return
environment. The earliest remains of modern humans, known as
Homo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand
years old. These were the first humans to have a brain relatively
similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest part of the
brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—
was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today.
You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic
ancestors.
