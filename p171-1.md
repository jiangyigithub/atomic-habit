This is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones.
Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you
accrued from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten
squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a
zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.

Furthermore, it’s not always about what happens during the
workout. It’s about being the type of person who doesn’t miss
workouts. It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show
up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope.
Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance,
but it reaffirms your identity.

The all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that
can derail your habits. Another potential danger—especially if you are
using a habit tracker—is measuring the wrong thing.
