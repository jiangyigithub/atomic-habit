the core tech is abroad?

while i work in BOSCH and Veoneer, I find one phenomenon, the good software is wrote by foreign colleagues, which people you may never say these gays.
why, tech is common, the physics between china and American has no difference, the can be copy.like the university major, a lot of material of major in chinese is absolutely copy from western country.a lot of students complain the low quality of chinese domestic material.

i think it is a harm to workers like me, because the contact of people is lacked.after this project, these code is no-valuable, i speed my time only once.

what's the different between people VS things.
1. people can grow,it's dynamics and have compound interest
2. thing , thing will be deprecated.
we create value by doing thing,but all thing is done by people, a thing can be finished,but people will grow continually.
