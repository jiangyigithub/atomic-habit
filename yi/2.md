the core tech is abroad?

while i work in BOSCH and Veoneer, I find one phonothph, the good software is writed by forign collegues, which people you may never say these gays.
why, tech is common, the phycics between china and Ameraican has no differece, the can be copy.like the university major, a lot of material of major in chinese is absolutely copy from western contry.a lot of students complain the low quality of chinese domestric material.

i think it is a harm to workers like me, because the contact of people is lacked.after this project, these code is no-valuable, i speed my time only once.

what's the different between people VS things.
1. people can grow,it's dynamics and have compound interest
2. thing , thing will be deprecated.
we creat value by doing thing,but all thing is done by people, a thing can be finished,but people will grow continuely.
