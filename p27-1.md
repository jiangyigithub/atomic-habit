FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD

`Prevailing` wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in
life—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing
more and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—
is to set specific, actionable goals.

For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each
one was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get
in school, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I
wanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of
them. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do
with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I
followed.

忘记目标，转而专注于系统

"流行的"智慧声称，在生活中实现我们所渴望的目标——变得更健康、建立成功的事业、更加放松和减少担忧、与朋友和家人共度更多时间——的最佳方式是设定具体可行的目标。

多年来，我也以这种方式来处理我的习惯。每个习惯都是一个要达到的目标。我为自己在学校想要取得的成绩、健身房中想要举起的重量、企业中想要获得的利润设定了目标。有些目标我成功实现了，但很多目标我失败了。最终，我开始意识到，我的结果与我设定的目标关系很小，几乎与我遵循的系统有着密切的关系。
