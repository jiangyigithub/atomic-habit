“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told me. “The
study participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.” The
soap foamed easily, and people were able to lather their hands with
suds. It smelled great. Instantly, handwashing became slightly more
pleasurable.

“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change
but as habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a lot easier for people to adopt
a product that provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example
the mint taste of toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not
provide pleasurable sensory feedback, like flossing one’s teeth. The
marketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to create a
positive handwashing experience.”

Within months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health of
children in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent;
pneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by
35 percent.
