When other researchers reversed this process and `flooded` the
reward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits
at `breakneck` speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of
dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes,
the mice developed a craving so strong they began poking their nose
into the box eight hundred times per hour. (Humans are not so
different: the average `slot machine` player will spin the wheel six
hundred times per hour.)

Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is
highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video
games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of
dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors
like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.

For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but
now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes,
including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and
`aversion`, and voluntary movement.
