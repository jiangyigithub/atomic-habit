In total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the
cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models
of human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of
external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits. While some of 
the language may be familiar, I am confident that the details and the 
applications of the Four Laws of Behavior Change—will offer a new 
way to think about your habits. 

Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment
to moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t
change. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting
principles you can rely on year after year. The ideas you can build a
business around, build a family around, build a life around.

There is no one right way to create better habits, but this book
describes the best way I know—an approach that will be effective
regardless of where you start or what you’re trying to change. The
strategies I cover will be `relevant to` anyone looking for a step-by-step
system for improvement, whether your goals center on health, money,
productivity, `relationships`, or all of the above. As long as human
behavior is involved, this book will be your guide.
