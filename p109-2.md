3. Imitating the Powerful

Humans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We want pins
and medallions on our jackets. We want President or Partner in our
titles. We want to be acknowledged, recognized, and praised. This
tendency can seem vain, but overall, itâ€™s a smart move. Historically, a
person with greater power and status has access to more resources,
worries less about survival, and proves to be a more attractive mate.

We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval,
admiration, and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do
muscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord
progressions or the parent with the most accomplished children
because these things separate us from the crowd. Once we fit in, we
start looking for ways to stand out.
