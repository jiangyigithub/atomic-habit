WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE

It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment
and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily
`basis`. Too often, we convince ourselves that `massive` success requires
massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business,
writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal,
we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering
improvement that everyone will talk about.

Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—
sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful,
especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can
make over time is `astounding`. Here’s how the math works out: if you
can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-
seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1
percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to
zero. What starts as a small win or a minor `setback` accumulates into
something much more.

为什么小习惯产生重大差异

我们很容易高估一个决定性时刻的重要性，低估每天进行小改进的价值。我们常常说服自己，取得巨大的成功需要巨大的行动。无论是减肥、创业、写书、赢得冠军还是实现任何其他目标，我们对自己施加压力，要做出一些轰动效应的改进，让每个人都会谈论。

与此同时，每天提升1％并不特别引人注目，有时甚至察觉不到，但它在长期内可能更具意义。随着时间推移，微小的改进能够产生令人惊人的差异。以下是数学计算：如果你每天进步1％，一年后你的能力将增长37倍。相反，如果你每天退步1％，一年后你将接近于零。一个小小的胜利或轻微的挫折会累积成更大的成果。
