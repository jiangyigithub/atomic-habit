The Two-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. You
know that the real goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it may
feel like you’re trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring to
read one page or do one push-up or open their notes. And if you know
it’s a mental trick, why would you fall for it?
If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes
and then stop. Go for a run, but you must stop after two minutes. Start
meditating, but you must stop after two minutes. Study Arabic, but
you must stop after two minutes. It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the
whole thing. Your habit can only last one hundred and twenty
seconds.

One of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred
pounds. In the beginning, he went to the gym each day, but he told
himself he wasn’t allowed to stay for more than five minutes. He
would go to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave as soon as his
time was up. After a few weeks, he looked around and thought, “Well,
I’m always coming here anyway. I might as well start staying a little
longer.” A few years later, the weight was gone.
