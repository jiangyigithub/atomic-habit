I hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, there
was nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I never
ended up playing professionally. However, looking back on those
years, I believe I accomplished something just as rare: I fulfilled my
potential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfill
your potential as well.

We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the
experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and
unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re
willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in
the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of
our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results.
But with better habits, anything is possible.

Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success
overnight. I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of
them. There wasn’t one defining moment on my journey from
medically induced coma to Academic All-American; there were many.
It was a gradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny
breakthroughs. The only way I made progress—the only choice I had—
was to start small. And I employed this same strategy a few years later
when I started my own business and began working on this book.
