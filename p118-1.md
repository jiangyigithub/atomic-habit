Finance. Saving money is often associated with `sacrifice`.
However, you can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if
you realize one simple truth: living below your current means
increases your future means. The money you save this month
increases your purchasing power next month.

Meditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three
seconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next `distraction`
inevitably pops into your mind. You can transform `frustration` into
delight when you realize that each interruption gives you a chance to
practice returning to your breath. Distraction is a good thing because
you need distractions to practice meditation.

Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big
presentation or competing in an important event. They experience
quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened `arousal`. If we
interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense
up. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with
`fluidity` and grace. You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited
and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”
