The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].

After I `hang up` the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper
clip over.

After I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout
journal.

After I put my plate in the `dishwasher`, I will write down what I
ate.

These `tactics` can make tracking your habits easier. Even if you
aren’t the type of person who enjoys recording your behavior, I think
you’ll find a few weeks of measurements to be `insightful`. It’s always
interesting to see how you’ve actually been spending your time.

`That said`, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more
important than any single measurement, is having a good plan for
when your habits `slide off` track.
