By comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your
attention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff
at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked
like a fly near the center of each urinal. Apparently, when men stepped
up to the urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug. The
stickers improved their aim and significantly reduced “spillage”
around the urinals. Further analysis determined that the `stickers` cut
bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year.

I’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. I used to
buy apples from the store, put them in the `crisper` in the bottom of the
refrigerator, and forget all about them. By the time I remembered, the
apples would have gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.
