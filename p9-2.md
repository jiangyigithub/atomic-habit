MY RECOVERY

`Mercifully`, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the
point where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the `coma`.
When I finally regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my
ability to smell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and `sniff`
an apple juice box. My sense of smell returned, but—to everyone’s
surprise—the act of blowing my nose forced air through the fractures
in my eye socket and pushed my left eye outward. My eyeball bulged
out of the socket, held `precariously` in place by my eyelid and the optic
nerve attaching my eye to my brain.

The ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into
place as the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would
take. I was scheduled for `surgery` one week later, which would allow
me some additional time to heal. I looked like I had been on the wrong
end of a boxing match, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I
returned home with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a
bulging left eye.
