Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to
become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the
votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one
reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small
habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a
new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. Thatâ€™s
the paradox of making small improvements.

Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to
changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are
is to change what you do.

Each time you write a page, you are a writer.
Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.
Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.
Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.
