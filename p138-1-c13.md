How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule

TWYLA THARP IS widely regarded as one of the greatest dancers and
choreographers of the modern era. In 1992, she was awarded a
MacArthur Fellowship, often referred to as the Genius Grant, and she
has spent the bulk of her career touring the globe to perform her
`original works`. She also credits much of her success to simple daily
habits.

“I begin each day of my life with a `ritual`,” she writes. “I wake up at
5:30 A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweat
shirt, and my hat. I walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and
tell the driver to take me to the Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and
First Avenue, where I work out for two hours.

“The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body
through each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I
tell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual.

“It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning
habitualizes it—makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance
that I would skip it or do it differently. It is one more item in my
arsenal of routines, and one less thing to think about.”

Hailing a cab each morning may be a tiny action, but it is a `splendid`
example of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.
