These two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours per year—
but they are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual
slide that happens when I don’t pay close attention. They provide an
annual reminder to revisit my desired identity and consider how my
habits are helping me become the type of person I wish to be. They
indicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on new challenges
and when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the fundamentals.

Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are
powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much
about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from
an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the
bigger picture. There is too much feedback. Conversely, never
reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror. You aren’t
aware of easily fixable flaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your
teeth. There is too little feedback. Periodic reflection and review is like
viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can
see the important changes you should make without losing sight of the
bigger picture. You want to view the entire mountain range, not obsess
over each peak and valley.

Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of
the most important aspects of behavior change: identity.
