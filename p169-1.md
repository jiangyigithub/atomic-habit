Tracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your
entire life. But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if
it’s only temporary.

What can we do to make tracking easier?

First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. You’ll
probably be surprised by how much you’re already tracking without
knowing it. Your credit card statement tracks how often you go out to
eat. Your Fitbit registers how many steps you take and how long you
sleep. Your calendar records how many new places you travel to each
year. Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar
to review it each week or each month, which is more practical than
tracking it every day.

Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important
habits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to `sporadically`
track ten.

Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habit
occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This
approach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned
in Chapter 5 with habit tracking.
