This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change.
Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. I’m often
surprised by how effective simple changes like these can be. Remove a
single cue and the entire habit often fades away.

Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may
be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can
muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of
summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the
right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your
environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your
good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.
