If you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the
week, month, or year. People are more likely to take action at those
times because hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a
reason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating.

There is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being
specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say
no to things that `derail` progress, distract your attention, and pull you
off course. We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear
enough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams
are `vague`, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and
never `get around to` the specific things you need to do to succeed.
