Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity
Report. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report
helps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on
course. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider
whether I have been living `in accordance with` them. This is when I
reflect on my identity and how I can work toward being the type of
person I wish to become.*

My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:

1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?
2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?
3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?
