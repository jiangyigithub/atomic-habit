It is a simple two-step process:

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. `Prove` it to yourself with small wins.

First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an
individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want
to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to
become?

These are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to
begin—but they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-
pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double their salary. That’s fine.
Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of
person who could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of
person that could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person
that could lose `forty` pounds? Who is the type of person that could
learn a new language? Who is the type of person that could run a
successful start-up?
