Usually, this minor `dip` in performance is no cause for worry. You
don’t need a system to continuously improve how well you brush your
teeth or tie your shoes or make your morning cup of tea. With habits
like these, good enough is usually good enough. The less energy you
spend on `trivial` choices, the more you can spend it on what really
matters.

However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve
elite levels of performance, you need a more `nuanced` approach. You
can’t repeat the same things `blindly` and expect to become `exceptional`.
Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is
a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
