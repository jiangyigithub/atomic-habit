We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering
the decisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day
is made up of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices
that determine the path you take. These little choices stack up, each
one setting the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time.

Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not
the gym.

THE TWO-MINUTE RULE

Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big.
When you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes
over and you end up trying to do too much too soon. The most
effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-
Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take
less than two minutes to do.”
