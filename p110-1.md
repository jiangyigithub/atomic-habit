This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly
effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people
because we desire success ourselves. Many of our daily habits are
`imitations` of people we admire. You replicate the marketing strategies
of the most successful firms in your industry. You make a `recipe` from
your favorite baker. You borrow the storytelling strategies of your
favorite writer. You mimic the communication style of your boss. We
imitate people we envy.

High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of
others. And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and
praise, we find it attractive.
