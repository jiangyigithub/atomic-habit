The Best Way to Start a New Habit

IN 2001, RESEARCHERS in Great Britain began working with 248 people
to build better exercise habits over the course of two weeks. The
subjects were divided into three groups.

The first group was the control group. They were simply asked to
track how often they exercised.

The second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not
only to track their workouts but also to read some material on the
benefits of exercise. The researchers also explained to the group how
exercise could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve
heart health.
