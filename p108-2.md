Asch ran this experiment many times and in many different ways.
What he discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did
the `conformity` of the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor,
then there was no effect on the person’s choice. They just assumed
they were in the room with a dummy. When two actors were in the
room with the subject, there was still little impact. But as the number
of people increased to three actors and four and all the way to eight,
the subject became more likely to second-guess themselves. By the end
of the experiment, nearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with
the group answer even though it was obviously incorrect.

Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide
our behavior. We are constantly `scanning our environment` and
wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on
Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best”
buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is
evidence in numbers.
