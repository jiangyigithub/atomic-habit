After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and
`habitual` that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example,
Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act.
160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20,
12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”

During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5
minutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3
seconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions
became quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the same
mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.

From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by
stating, “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be
repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less
likely to be repeated.” His work provides the perfect `starting point` for
discussing how habits form in our own lives. It also provides answers
to some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And why does
the brain bother building them at all?
