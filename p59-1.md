Consider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t
necessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time
to eat. Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body
has a variety of feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time
to eat again and that track what is going on around you and within
you. Cravings can arise thanks to hormones and chemicals circulating
through your body. Suddenly, you’re hungry even though you’re not
quite sure what tipped you off.

This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you
don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice
an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention
to it. This is what makes habits useful.

It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions
come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind.
You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless
someone points it out, you may not notice that you cover your mouth
with your hand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking a
question, or that you have a habit of finishing other people’s sentences.
And the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you become to
question what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.
