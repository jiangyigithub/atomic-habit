One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity
an `overwhelming portion` of who you are. In the words of investor Paul
Graham, “keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief
define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges
you. If you tie everything up in being the point guard or the partner at
the firm or whatever else, then the loss of that `facet` of your life will
`wreck` you. If you’re a `vegan` and then develop a health condition that
forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis on your
hands. When you `cling` too tightly to one identity, you become `brittle`.
Lose that one thing and you lose yourself.

For most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of my
identity. After my baseball career ended, I struggled to find myself.
When you spend your whole life defining yourself in one way and that
disappears, who are you now?
