What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the `mental` state
you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the
rest of the world fades away. This blend of happiness and peak
performance is what athletes and performers experience when
they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow
state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.

Where do I get greater returns than the average person?
We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a
behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in
our favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list
grew very quickly. I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well, but I
knew that results seemed to be coming faster for me than for
some of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing.
