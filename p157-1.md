The long-term effects were even better. “We went back to some of
the households in Karachi six years after,” Luby told me. “Over 95
percent of households who had been given the soap for free and
encouraged to wash their hands had a handwashing station with soap
and water available when our study team visited. . . . We had not given
any soap to the intervention group for over five years, but during the
trial they had become so habituated to wash their hands, that they had
maintained the practice.” It was a powerful example of the fourth and
final Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying.

We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is
satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor
ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers
well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again,
next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth
remembering and repeating.

Take the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold
commercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until Wrigley
launched in 1891 that it became a worldwide habit. Early versions were
made from relatively bland resins—chewy, but not tasty. Wrigley
revolutionized the industry by adding flavors like Spearmint and Juicy
Fruit, which made the product flavorful and fun to use. Then they
went a step further and began pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a
clean mouth. Advertisements told readers to “Refresh Your Taste.”
