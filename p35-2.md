Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system
of a `democracy``is founded on` beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and
social `equality`. The system of a `dictatorship` has a very different set of
beliefs like absolute `authority` and strict `obedience`. You can imagine
many ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such
behavior change would `never get off the ground` in a dictatorship.
That’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is
impossible under a certain set of beliefs.

A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals,
organizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions
that shape the system, an identity behind the habits.

Behavior that is `incongruent` with the self will not last. You may
want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes
rather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending
rather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue
to `prioritize` comfort over accomplishment, you’ll `be drawn to` relaxing
rather than training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never
change the `underlying beliefs` that led to your past behavior. You have
a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.
