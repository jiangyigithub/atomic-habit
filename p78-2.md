The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely
you are to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and
visit Starbucks because it is on every corner. We like to think that we
are in control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because
we wanted to do so. The truth, however, is that many of the actions we
take each day are shaped not by `purposeful` drive and choice but by the
most obvious option.

Every living being has its own methods for sensing and
understanding the world. `Eagles` have remarkable long-distance
vision. Snakes can smell by “tasting the air” with their highly sensitive
`tongues`. Sharks can detect small amounts of electricity and vibrations
in the water caused by nearby fish. Even `bacteria` have `chemoreceptors`
—tiny sensory cells that allow them to detect `toxic chemicals` in their
environment.
