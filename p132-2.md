HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT

Imagine you are holding a garden hose that is `bent` in the middle.
Some water can flow through, but not very much. If you want to
increase the rate at which water passes through the hose, you have two
options. The first option is to `crank up` the valve and force more water
out. The second option is to simply remove the bend in the hose and
let water flow through naturally.

Trying to `pump up` your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like
trying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requires
a lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile,
making your habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the
hose. Rather than trying to overcome the friction in your life, you
reduce it.
