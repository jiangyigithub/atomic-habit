The secret to maximizing your `odds` of success is to choose the right
field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with
sports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying
to stick with, when they align with your natural `inclinations` and
abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on
the `track`, you want to play a game where the odds are `in your favor`.

Embracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth
that people are born with different abilities. Some people don’t like to
discuss this fact. On the surface, your `genes` seem to be fixed, and it’s
no fun to talk about things you cannot control. Plus, phrases like
biological determinism makes it sound like certain individuals are
`destined` for success and others `doomed to failure`. But this is a
`shortsighted view` of the influence of genes on behavior.

The strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot be
easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in
favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable
circumstances. If you want to `dunk` a basketball, being seven feet tall is
very useful. If you want to perform a `gymnastics` routine, being seven
feet tall is a great `hindrance`. Our environment determines the
`suitability` of our genes and the utility of our `natural talents`. When our
environment changes, so do the `qualities` that determine success.
