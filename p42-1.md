The concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to
another key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits
shape one way your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way
street. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will
explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your
deep values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.
The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not
getting a particular outcome.

THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER

Identity change is the North Star of habit change. The remainder of
this book will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to
build better habits in yourself, your family, your team, your company,
and anywhere else you wish. But the true question is: “Are you
becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not
what or how, but who.You need to know who you want to be.
Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a `rudder`. And
that’s why we are starting here.
