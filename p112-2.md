What was truly fascinating was that half of the people in the room
had managed to quit smoking. Mike had been smoke-free for a few
years at that point, and he `swore up and down` that he broke the habit
because of a book called Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking.

“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he said. “It tells
you: ‘Stop lying to yourself. You know you don’t actually want to
smoke. You know you don’t really enjoy this.’ It helps you feel like
you’re not the victim anymore. You start to realize that you don’t need
to smoke.”
