The following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life
was on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldnâ€™t see
straight. It took more than a month, but my eyeball did eventually
return to its normal location. Between the `seizures` and my vision
problems, it was eight months before I could drive a car again. At
physical `therapy`, I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in a
straight line. I was determined not to let my `injury` get me down, but
there were more than a few moments when I felt depressed and
`overwhelmed`.

I became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to
the baseball field one year later. Baseball had always been a major part
of my life. My dad had played minor `league` baseball for the St. Louis
Cardinals, and I had a dream of playing professionally, too. After
months of `rehabilitation`, what I wanted more than anything was to get
back on the field.
