How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

IN THE SUMMER OF 1830, Victor Hugo was facing an impossible deadline.
Twelve months earlier, the French author had promised his
publisher a new book. But instead of writing, he spent that year
`pursuing` other projects, entertaining guests, and delaying his work.
`Frustrated`, Hugoâ€™s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than
six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831.

Hugo `concocted` a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He
collected all of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in
a large `chest`. He was left with nothing to wear except a large `shawl`.
Lacking any suitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study
and wrote `furiously` during the fall and winter of 1830. The Hunchback
of Notre Dame was published two weeks early on January 14, 1831.*

Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more
about making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of
Behavior Change: make it difficult. If you find yourself continually
struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can `take a page`
from Victor Hugo and make your bad habits more difficult by creating
what psychologists call a `commitment device`.
