But what if you don’t want to leave it `up to luck`?

If you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor,
create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says,
“Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top
25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people,
but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average
standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most
people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s
the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when
you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few
cartoonists could hope to `understand without living it`.”

When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different.
By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which
makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic
advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good
player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great
player creates a new game that favors their `strengths` and avoids their
weaknesses.
