Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle
on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds
because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly
nonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t
expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you
make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will
call it fate.”

THE HABITS SCORECARD

The Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the
world. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice
that the conductors have a `peculiar` habit.

As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a `ritual` of
pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the
train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal
is green.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator
will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s
time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the
time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar
actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the
edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified,
pointed at, and named aloud.*
