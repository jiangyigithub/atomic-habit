Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external
environment for `hints` of where rewards are located. Because the cue is
the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a
craving.

Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force
behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—
without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is
not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave
smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are
not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a
clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be
`entertained`. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal
state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.
