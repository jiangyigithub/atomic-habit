No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a
successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.
Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time
and location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the
time and location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a
habit into your daily routine can make a big difference. If you’re trying
to add meditation into your morning routine but mornings are chaotic
and your kids keep running into the room, then that may be the wrong
place and time. Consider when you are most likely to be successful.
Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with
something else.

Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit.
If you want to do a habit every day, but you stack it on top of a habit
that only happens on Mondays, that’s not a good choice.
