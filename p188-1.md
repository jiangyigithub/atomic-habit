The optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. If
you have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career—
it makes more sense to explore because once you find the right thing,
you still have a good amount of time to exploit it. If you’re `pressed` for
time—say, as you come up on the deadline for a project—you should
implement the best solution you’ve found so far and get some results.

As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you
can ask yourself to continually `narrow in` on the habits and areas that
will be most satisfying to you:

What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of
whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but
whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most
people. When are you enjoying yourself while other people are
complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is
the work you were made to do.
