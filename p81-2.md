THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE

The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time
your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the
entire context surrounding the behavior.

For example, many people drink more in social situations than they
would ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather
the whole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the
music at the bar, seeing the beers on tap.

We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur:
the home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to
certain habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship
with the objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the
things in your bedroom.
