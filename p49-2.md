The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards
provide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you
need to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect.
Getting in shape improves your health and your dating `prospects`. But
the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat
or to gain status or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewards
deliver `contentment` and relief from craving.

Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in
the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life,
your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions
satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and
disappointment are part of the feedback `mechanism` that helps your
brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the
feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.
