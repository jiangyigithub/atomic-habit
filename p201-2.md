To become great, certain skills do need to become automatic.
Basketball players need to be able to `dribble` without thinking before
they can move on to mastering `layups` with their `nondominant hand`.
Surgeons need to repeat the first `incision` so many times that they
could do it with their eyes closed, so that they can focus on the
hundreds of variables that arise during surgery. But after one habit has
been mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and
begin building the next habit.

Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of
success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then
using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next `frontier`
of your development. Old tasks become easier the second time around,
but it doesn’t get easier overall because now you’re `pouring` your
energy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of
performance. It’s an endless cycle.

Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain
conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine
and improve. It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like
you have mastered a skill—right when things are starting to feel
automatic and you are becoming comfortable—that you must avoid
slipping into the trap of `complacency`.

The solution? Establish a system for reflection and review.
