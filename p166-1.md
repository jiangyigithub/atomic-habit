HOW TO KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK

A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.
The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you
stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by,
the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.

Countless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most
famous was Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklin
carried a small booklet everywhere he went and used it to track
thirteen personal virtues. This list included goals like “Lose no time.
Be always employed in something useful” and “Avoid `trifling`
conversation.” At the end of each day, Franklin would open his booklet
and record his progress.
