Cravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of
information could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not
motivated by the same cues. For a gambler, the sound of slot machines
can be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For
someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are
just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are
interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are
what transform a cue into a craving.

The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you
perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a
response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much
friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires
more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then
you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds
simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you
want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough to reach the
hoop, well, you’re out of luck.

Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of
every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about
wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We
chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and
(2) they teach us.
