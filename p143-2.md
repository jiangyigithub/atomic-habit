Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit
from getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most
people give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling
feels like a `chore`.* The secret is to always stay below the point where it
feels like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the
United Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically writing
less than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed
like a `hassle`. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any
kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going
good,” he said.

Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the
identity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days `in a row`
—even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new
identity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on
becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking
the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be.
