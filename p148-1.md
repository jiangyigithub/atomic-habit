HOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN

John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his
childhood doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his
father’s sawmill. After attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson
returned to Ohio and opened a small supply store for coal miners.

It seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition
and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make
money. That was when Patterson discovered his employees were
stealing from him.

In the mid-1800s, `employee theft` was a common problem. Receipts
were kept in an `open drawer` and could easily be altered or discarded.
There were no video cameras to review behavior and no software to
track transactions. Unless you were willing to `hover over` your
employees every minute of the day, or to manage all transactions
yourself, it was difficult to prevent theft.

As Patterson `mulled over` his predicament, he came across an
advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier.
Designed by fellow Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cash
register. The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts
inside after each transaction. Patterson bought two for fifty dollars
each.
