After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your
strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the
events that preceded the reward. Wait a minute—that felt good. What
did I do right before that?

This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn,
try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and
the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.

Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to
automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of
automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face
regularly. As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are,
simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”
