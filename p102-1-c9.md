The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

IN 1965, a Hungarian man named Laszlo Polgar `wrote` a `series` of
`strange` letters to a woman named Klara.

Laszlo was a `firm` believer in hard work. In fact, it was all he
believed in: he `completely` rejected the idea of `innate` talent. He
claimed that with `deliberate practice` and the development of good
habits, a child could become a `genius` in any field. His `mantra` was “A
genius is not `born`, but is educated and trained.”

Laszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with
his own children—and he was writing to Klara because he “needed a
wife willing to jump on board.” Klara was a teacher and, although she
may not have been as `adamant` as Laszlo, she also believed that with
proper `instruction`, anyone could advance their skills.

Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment,
and he `laid out` a plan to `raise` his children to become `chess prodigies`.
The kids would be home-schooled, a `rarity` in Hungary at the time. The
house would be filled with chess books and pictures of `famous` chess
players. The children would play against each other constantly and
`compete` in the best `tournaments` they could find. The family would
keep a `meticulous` `file` system of the tournament history of every
`competitor` the children faced. Their `lives` would be `dedicated` to chess.
