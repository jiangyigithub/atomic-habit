The habit stacking formula is:
“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

For example:

Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will
meditate for one minute.

Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately
change into my workout clothes.

Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m
grateful for that happened today.

Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a
kiss.

Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or
family member where I am running and how long it will take.

The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already
do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can
begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This
allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes
from one behavior leading into the next—a positive version of the
Diderot Effect.
