A few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a
separate room for my office. Suddenly, work was something that
happened “in here” and personal life was something that happened
“out there.” It was easier for me to turn off the professional side of my
brain when there was a clear dividing line between work life and home
life. Each room had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking. The
office was for working.

Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with
another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—
and the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why the
versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness.
You can use your phone for all sorts of tasks, which makes it a
powerful device. But when you can use your phone to do nearly
anything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to be
productive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social media, check
email, and play video games whenever you open your phone. It’s a
mishmash of cues.
