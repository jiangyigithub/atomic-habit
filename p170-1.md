HOW TO RECOVER QUICKLY WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK DOWN

No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that
life will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before
long, an emergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel for
work or your family needs a little more of your time.

Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple
rule: never miss twice.

If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible.
Missing one workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row.
Maybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I
can’t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak
ends, I get started on the next one.
