Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.

The `implicit` assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my
goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first `mentality` is
that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.
I’ve slipped into this trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years,
happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I
promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after
my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally
relax.

Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve
your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.
You `mentally` box yourself into a `narrow` version of happiness. This is
misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match
the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense
to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths
to success.

A systems-first mentality provides the `antidote`. When you fall in
love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to
give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime
your system is running. And a system can be successful in many
different forms, not just the one you first `envision`.
