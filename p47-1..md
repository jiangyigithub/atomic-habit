Despite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits
of habits. The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life `dull`? I
don’t want to `pigeonhole` myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy. Doesn’t
so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?”
Hardly. Such questions set up a false dichotomy. They make you think
that you have to choose between building habits and attaining
freedom. In reality, the two complement each other.

Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people
who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least
amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be
struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will
always seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you
will always feel like you’re behind the curve. If you’re always being
forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when should I work out,
where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have less time
for freedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that
you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and
creativity.
