Why is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their habits—
whether practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or playing guitar—while
most of us struggle to stay motivated? How do we design habits that
pull us in rather than ones that fade away? Scientists have been
studying this question for many years. While there is still much to
learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain
motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just
`manageable` difficulty.”

The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an
optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious
match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too
easy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional
tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly
lose motivation because the match is too difficult.
