HOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE

The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if
it’s in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit
paid off and that the work was worth the effort.

In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In
the real world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have
provided you with something. Early on, it’s all sacrifice. You’ve gone to
the gym a few times, but you’re not stronger or fitter or faster—at least,
not in any noticeable sense. It’s only months later, once you shed a few
pounds or your arms gain some definition, that it becomes easier to
exercise for its own sake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stay
on track. This is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep you
excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.

What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing
immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any
experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other
phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The best
approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using
an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. Habit
stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an
immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement
ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying
when you finish.
