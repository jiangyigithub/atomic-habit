One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take
to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is,
“How many does it take to form a new habit?” That is, how many
repetitions are required to make a habit automatic?

There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit
formation. It doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one days or thirty days
or three hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you perform
the behavior. You could do something twice in thirty days, or two
hundred times. It’s the frequency that makes the difference. Your
current habits have been `internalized` over the course of hundreds, if
not thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the same level of
frequency. You need to `string together` enough successful attempts
until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the
Habit Line.
