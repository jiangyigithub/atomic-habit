The Secret to Self-Control

IN 1971, as the `Vietnam` War was `heading into` its sixteenth year,
`congressmen` Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy
from Illinois made a discovery that `stunned` the American public.
While visiting the `troops`, they had learned that over 15 percent of U.S.
soldiers `stationed` there were `heroin` `addicts`. `Follow-up research`
revealed that 35 percent of `service members` in Vietnam had tried
heroin and as many as 20 percent were addictedâ€”the problem was
even worse than they had initially thought.

The discovery led to a `flurry` of activity in Washington, including the
creation of the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention under
President Nixon to promote prevention and `rehabilitation` and to track
addicted service members when they returned home.
