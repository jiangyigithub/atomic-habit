If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a
big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually
have multiple cues. Consider how many different ways a smoker could
be prompted to pull out a cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend
smoke, feeling stressed at work, and so on.

The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling
triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that
youâ€™ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best
choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and
natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.

Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how
we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people
live in a world others have created for them. But you can alter the
spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive
cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment design
allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life.
Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.
