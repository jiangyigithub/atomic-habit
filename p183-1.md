Now, imagine if these `world-class athletes` were to switch sports.
Given his remarkable athleticism, could Michael Phelps become an
Olympic-caliber distance runner with enough training? It’s unlikely.
At peak fitness, Phelps weighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent
heavier than El Guerrouj, who competed at an ultralight 138 pounds.
Taller runners are heavier runners, and every extra pound is a `curse`
when it comes to distance running. Against `elite` competition, Phelps
would be doomed from the start.

Similarly, El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in history,
but it’s doubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer.
Since 1976, the average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s
1,500-meter run is five feet, ten inches. In comparison, the average
height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle
swim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and have long
backs and arms, which are ideal for pulling through the water. El
Guerrouj would be at a severe disadvantage before he ever touched the
pool.
