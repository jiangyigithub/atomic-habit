The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
The goal is not to run a `marathon`, the goal is to become a runner.
The goal is not to learn an `instrument`, the goal is to become a
`musician`.

Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you
do is an `indication` of the type of person you believe that you are—
either `consciously` or nonconsciously.* Research has `shown` that once a
person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more
likely to act in alignment with that belief. For example, people who
identified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than those who
simply `claimed` “voting” was an action they wanted to perform.
Similarly, the person who `incorporates` exercise into their identity
doesn’t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is
easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned,
you are no longer `pursuing` behavior change. You are simply acting like
the type of person you `already` believe yourself to be.
