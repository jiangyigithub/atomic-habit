Humans are also `prone` to fall for exaggerated versions of reality.
Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a `frenzy`. After
spending hundreds of thousands of years `hunting` and `foraging` for
food in the `wild`, the human brain has `evolved to` place a high value on
salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were
quite rare when our `ancient` `ancestors` were `roaming` the `savannah`.
When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as
much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.

Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is
`abundant`, but your brain continues to crave it like it is `scarce`. Placing
a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our
health, but the craving persists because the brain’s reward centers
have not changed for `approximately` fifty thousand years. The modern
food industry relies on `stretching` our Paleolithic instincts beyond their
evolutionary purpose.

`A primary goal` of food science is to create products that are more
attractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or `jar` has
been enhanced in some way, if only with additional `flavoring`.
Companies spend millions of dollars to discover the most satisfying
level of `crunch` in a potato chip or the perfect amount of `fizz` in a soda.
Entire departments `are dedicated to` optimizing how a product feels in
your mouth—a quality known as orosensation. French `fries`, for
example, are a potent combination—golden brown and crunchy on the
outside, light and smooth on the inside.
