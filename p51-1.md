This four-step process is not something that happens occasionally,
but rather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active
during every moment you are aliveâ€”even now. The brain is
continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen
next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results. The
entire process is completed in a split second, and we use it again and
again without realizing everything that has been packed into the
previous moment.

We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase
and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the
craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change.
The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is
when you take action and achieve the change you desire.
