The story of Brian Clark, an `entrepreneur` from Boulder, Colorado,
provides a good example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve `chewed`
my `fingernails`,” Clark told me. “It started as a `nervous` habit when I
was young, and then `morphed into` an undesirable `grooming ritual`.
One day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.
Through mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”

Then, Clark did something surprising.

“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever `manicure`,” he said. “My
`thought` was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t
chew them. And it worked, but not for the `monetary` reason. What
happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the
first time. The manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I
had really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my
fingernails. And even though that’s something I had never aspired to,
it made all the difference. I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a
`single` close call. And it’s because I now take pride in `properly` caring
for them.”
