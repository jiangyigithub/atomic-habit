The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado,
provides a good example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed
my fingernails,” Clark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I
was young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual.
One day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.
Through mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”

Then, Clark did something surprising.

“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said. “My
thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t
chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What
happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the
first time. The manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I
had really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my
fingernails. And even though that’s something I had never aspired to,
it made all the difference. I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a
single close call. And it’s because I now take pride in properly caring
for them.”

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes
part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who
wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person
who is this.

The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the
more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If
you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to
care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps,
you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re
proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours
knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth
and nail to maintain your habits.

True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit
because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that
it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to
visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the
belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term
changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of
who you are.
