This is true not just for `physical` characteristics but for `mental` ones
as well. I’m smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior; not
so much when it comes to `knitting`, rocket propulsion, or guitar
chords. Competence is highly dependent on context.

The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well
trained, they are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you
want to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.

In short: genes do not determine your `destiny`. They determine your
areas of opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can
predispose, but they don’t predetermine.” The areas where you are
genetically `predisposed` to success are the areas where habits are more
likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your effort toward areas that
both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition
with your ability.

The obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in
my favor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right
for me?” The first place we will look for an answer is by understanding
your personality.
