Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but
by our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about
the influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking
about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it
as filled with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with
the spaces around you. For one person, her couch is the place where
she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where
he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different
people can have different memories—and thus different habits—
associated with the same place.

The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit
with a particular context.

In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only
when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit
in a different room until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects
began to associate the context of their bed with the action of sleeping,
and it became easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed.
Their brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their phones, not
watching television, not staring at the clock—was the only action that
happened in that room.
