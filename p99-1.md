You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one
of your favorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear
about the latest `celebrity gossip`, but you need to get in shape. Using
temptation bundling, you could only read the tabloids and watch
reality shows at the gym. Maybe you want to get a `pedicure`, but you
need to clean out your email inbox. Solution: only get a pedicure while
processing overdue work emails.

Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory
known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor
David Premack, the principle states that “more `probable` behaviors will
reinforce less probable behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t
really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become `conditioned`
to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along
the way.
