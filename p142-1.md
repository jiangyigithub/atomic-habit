You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your
desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very
easy” to “very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard.
Running a 5K is hard. Walking ten thousand steps is moderately
difficult. Walking ten minutes is easy. And putting on your running
shoes is very easy. Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your
gateway habit is to put on your running shoes. That’s how you follow
the Two-Minute Rule.
