With a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat
some behaviors and avoid others, let’s update the Cardinal Rule of
Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is
immediately punished is avoided.

Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth
about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all
day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road
of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll
face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes,
the last mile is always the least crowded.
