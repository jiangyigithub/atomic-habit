Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and
immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. I
made this mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my
habit stack was “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten pushups.”
At first glance, this sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the
trigger was unclear. Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After
I ate lunch? Where would I do them? After a few inconsistent days, I
changed my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do
ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.

Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these
goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific
and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit
down at the table. The specificity is important. The more tightly bound
your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will
notice when the time comes to act.

The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies
like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most
practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear
plan for when and where to take action.
