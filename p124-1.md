If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not
perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit.
You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law:
you just need to get your `reps` in.

HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?

Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes
`progressively` more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat
an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become
efficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long-term
`potentiation`, which refers to the strengthening of connections between
neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity. With each
repetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural connections
tighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949,
this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that
fire together wire together.”

Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. In
musicians, the cerebellum—critical for physical movements like
`plucking` a guitar string or pulling a violin bow—is larger than it is in
nonmusicians. Mathematicians, meanwhile, have increased gray
matter in the `inferior` parietal lobule, which plays a key role in
computation and calculation. Its size is directly correlated with the
amount of time spent in the field; the older and more experienced the
mathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter.
