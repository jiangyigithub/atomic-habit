When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend
your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we
hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to
pour into the next stage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher
Alfred North Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending
the number of operations we can perform without thinking about
them.”

Of course, the power of technology can work against us as well.
Binge-watching becomes a habit because you have to put more effort
in to stop looking at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of
pressing a button to advance to the next episode, Netflix or YouTube
will autoplay it for you. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.
