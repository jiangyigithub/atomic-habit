Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy
required, the less likely it is to occur. If your goal is to do a hundred
push-ups per day, that’s a lot of energy! In the beginning, when you’re
motivated and excited, you can `muster the strength` to get started. But
after a few days, such a massive effort feels exhausting. Meanwhile,
sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost no
energy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the more
likely it is to occur.

Look at any behavior that `fills up` much of your life and you’ll see
that it can be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like
`scrolling` on our phones, checking email, and watching television steal
so much of our time because they can be performed almost without
effort. They are remarkably convenient.
