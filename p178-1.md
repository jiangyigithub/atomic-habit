The strategy worked. With his wife and trainer acting as
accountability partners and with the habit contract clarifying exactly
what to do each day, Harris lost the weight.*

To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them
painful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward
way to do exactly that.

Even if you don’t want to create a `full-blown` habit contract, simply
having an accountability partner is useful. The comedian Margaret
Cho writes a joke or song every day. She does the “song a day”
challenge with a friend, which helps them both stay `accountable`.
Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator. You
are less likely to procrastinate or give up because there is an
immediate cost. If you don’t `follow through`, perhaps they’ll see you as
untrustworthy or lazy. Suddenly, you are not only failing to `uphold`
your promises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your promises to
others.
