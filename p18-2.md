As these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated,
the results came faster than anyone could have imagined.

Just five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team
dominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic
Games in Beijing, where they won an `astounding` 60 percent of the
gold medals available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games
came to London, the Brits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic
records and seven world records.

That same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to
win the Tour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froome
won the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and
2017, giving the British team five Tour de France victories in six years.
During the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won
178 world championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold
medals and captured five Tour de France victories in what is widely
regarded as the most successful run in cycling history.

How does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary
athletes transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at
first glance, would seem to make a `modest` difference at best? Why do
small improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and
how can you `replicate` this approach in your own life?

随着这些以及其他数以百计的小改进的积累，结果比任何人都能想象的更快地到来。

在布雷尔斯福德接管英国自行车队仅仅五年后，他们在2008年北京奥运会的公路和场地自行车比赛中占据主导地位，赢得了令人惊叹的60％金牌。四年后，当奥运会来到伦敦时，英国再次创造奇迹，刷新了九项奥运纪录和七项世界纪录。

同年，布拉德利·维金斯成为第一位赢得环法自行车赛的英国选手。接下来的一年，他的队友克里斯·弗鲁姆赢得了这个赛事，并在2015年、2016年和2017年再次获胜，使英国队在六年内赢得了五次环法自行车赛冠军。在2007年至2017年的十年间，英国自行车选手赢得了178项世界冠军和66枚奥运或残奥会金牌，在自行车历史上被广泛认为是最成功的时期。

这是如何发生的呢？以往普通的运动员如何通过一些看似最多只能带来些许改善的微小变化，转变为世界冠军？为什么小的改进能够累积成如此显著的结果，你又如何在自己的生活中复制这种方法呢？
