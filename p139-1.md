Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any
given day are done `out of` habit. This is already a substantial
percentage, but the true influence of your habits is even greater than
these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic choices that influence
the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be completed in
just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you `take for`
minutes or hours afterward.

Habits are like the `entrance` ramp to a highway. They lead you down
a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next
behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing
than to start doing something different. You sit through a bad movie
for two hours. You keep `snacking` even when you’re already full. You
check your phone for “just a second” and soon you have spent twenty
minutes staring at the screen. In this way, the habits you follow
without thinking often determine the choices you make when you are
thinking.
