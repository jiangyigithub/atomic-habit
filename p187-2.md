In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of
exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called
the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try
out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide
net.

After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best
solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The
proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you
are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently
losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.

In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy
that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the
time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google
famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on
their official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has
led to the creation of `blockbuster` products like AdWords and Gmail.
