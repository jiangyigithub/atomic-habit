Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time.
Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad
habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate
outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate
outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. The
French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when
he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate
consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and
vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more
bitter are its later fruits.”

Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present.
The costs of your bad habits are in the future.

The brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you
can’t rely on good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight,
write a book, or learn a language—you are actually making plans for
your future self. And when you envision what you want your life to be
like, it is easy to see the value in taking actions with long-term
benefits. We all want better lives for our future selves. However, when
the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins. You
are no longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being
fitter or wealthier or happier. You are choosing for Present You, who
wants to be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general rule, the
more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly
you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.*
