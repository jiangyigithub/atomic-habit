Nearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a two-minute
behavior. I want to live a healthy and long life > I need to stay in shape
> I need to exercise > I need to change into my workout clothes. I want
to have a happy marriage > I need to be a good partner > I should do
something each day to make my partner’s life easier > I should meal
plan for next week.

Whenever you are struggling to stick with a habit, you can employ
the Two-Minute Rule. It’s a simple way to make your habits easy.

Chapter Summary

Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact
your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.

Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a
fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a
productive day or an unproductive one.

The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it
should take less than two minutes to do.”

The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely
it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is
required to do great things.

Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that
doesn’t exist.
