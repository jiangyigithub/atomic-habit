You can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an
entrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning.
And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says,
“It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via
PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t `malfunction`.”

We are always trying to present our best `selves` to the world. We
`comb` our hair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully
because we know these habits are likely to get a positive reaction. We
want to get good grades and graduate from top schools to impress
potential employers and mates and our friends and family. We care
about the opinions of those around us because it helps if others like us.
This is `precisely why` getting an accountability partner or signing a
habit contract can work so well.
