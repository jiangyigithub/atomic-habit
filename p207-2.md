HOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THAT HOLD YOU BACK

In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of
your desired identity. As you `latch` on to that new identity, however,
those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth.
When working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that
encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly
growing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits.

The more `sacred` an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied
to our identity—the more strongly we will `defend` it against criticism.
You see this in every industry. The schoolteacher who ignores
`innovative` teaching methods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson
plans. The veteran manager who is committed to doing things “his
way.” The surgeon who `dismisses` the ideas of her younger colleagues.
The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and then gets
stuck in a `rut`. The `tighter` we `cling` to an identity, the harder it becomes
to grow beyond it.
