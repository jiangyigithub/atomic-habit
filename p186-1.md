Our habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there
is no doubt that our genes `nudge` us in a certain direction. Our deeply
rooted preferences make certain behaviors easier for some people than
for others. You don’t have to apologize for these differences or feel
guilty about them, but you do have to work with them. A person who
scores lower on conscientiousness, for example, will be less likely to be
orderly by nature and may need to rely more heavily on environment
design to stick with good habits. (As a reminder for the less
conscientious readers among us, environment design is a strategy we
discussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)

The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your
personality.* People can get `ripped` working out like a bodybuilder, but
if you prefer rock climbing or cycling or rowing, then shape your
exercise habit around your interests. If your friend follows a low-carb
diet but you find that low-fat works for you, then more power to you. If
you want to read more, don’t be embarrassed if you prefer `steamy`
romance novels over nonfiction. Read whatever fascinates you.* You
don’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the
habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.

There is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and
satisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to
stick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law.

`Tailoring` your habits to your personality is a good start, but this is
not the end of the story. Let’s turn our attention to finding and
designing situations where you’re at a natural advantage.
