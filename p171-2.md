KNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT

Say you’re running a restaurant and you want to know if your chef is
doing a good job. One way to measure success is to track how many
customers pay for a meal each day. If more customers come in, the
food must be good. If fewer customers come in, something must be
wrong.

However, this one measurement—daily revenue—only gives a
limited picture of what’s really going on. Just because someone pays
for a meal doesn’t mean they enjoy the meal. Even dissatisfied
customers are unlikely to `dine` and `dash`. In fact, if you’re only
measuring revenue, the food might be getting worse but you’re making
up for it with marketing or discounts or some other method. Instead, it
may be more effective to track how many customers finish their meal
or perhaps the percentage of customers who leave a generous tip.
