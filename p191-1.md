Furthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing
the work. Yes, it’s possible that the `ripped` trainer at the gym has better
genes, but if you haven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say if
you have been `dealt` a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as
hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.

In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain
satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your
personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.
