Your outcomes are a `lagging` measure of your habits. Your net worth
is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging
measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of
your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning
habits. You get what you repeat.

If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do
is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily
choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you
spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the
gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new
each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your
future self.

你的结果是习惯的滞后度量。你的净资产是你财务习惯的滞后度量。你的体重是你饮食习惯的滞后度量。你的知识是你学习习惯的滞后度量。你的杂乱是你清理习惯的滞后度量。你会得到你重复的东西。

如果你想预测自己将来会达到何种境地，你只需要遵循微小收益或微小损失的曲线，并看看你每天的选择会如何在十年或二十年后累积起来。你每个月的支出是否少于收入？你每周是否能去健身房？你每天是否阅读书籍并学到新东西？这些微小的斗争将定义你未来的自己。
