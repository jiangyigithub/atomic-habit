As this book `draws` to a close, I hope the opposite is true. With the
Four Laws of Behavior Change, you have a set of tools and strategies
that you can use to build better systems and shape better habits.
Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it
obvious. Other times you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to
make it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too
difficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won’t
feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying.


Behaviors are effortless here. Behaviors are difficult here.
Obvious                        Invisible
Attractive                     Unattractive
Easy                           Hard
Satisfying                     Unsatisfying

You want to push your good habits toward the left side of the `spectrum` by
making them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Meanwhile, you want
to cluster your bad habits toward the right side by making them invisible,
unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.
