Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points
or statistics but about giving your “best effort `spiritually` and mentally
and physically.” Players `got credit` for “allowing an opponent to run
into you when you know that a foul will be called against him, diving
for loose balls, going after rebounds whether you are likely to get them
or not, helping a teammate when the player he’s guarding has surged
past him, and other ‘unsung hero’ deeds.”

As an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers star player
at the time—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5
turnovers in a game. Magic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed
by diving after a loose ball (+1). Finally, he played a total of 33 minutes
in this imaginary game.

The positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we
subtract the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33
minutes played.

29/33 = 0.879
