Chapter Summary

The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.

The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to
become habit-forming.

Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine
rises, so does our motivation to act.

It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that
gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the
dopamine spike.

Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more
attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an
action you need to do.
