Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on
your smallest `whims` and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger,
you can have food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of
`boredom`, you can get lost in the vast expanse of social media. When
the effort required to `act on` your desires becomes effectively zero, you
can find yourself slipping into whatever `impulse` arises at the moment.
The `downside` of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping
from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but
ultimately more rewarding, work.

I often find myself `gravitating toward` social media during any
downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my
phone. It’s easy to write off these minor distractions as “just taking a
break,” but over time they can accumulate into a serious issue. The
constant tug of “just one more minute” can prevent me from doing
anything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The average person
spends over two hours per day on social media. What could you do
with an extra six hundred hours per year?)
