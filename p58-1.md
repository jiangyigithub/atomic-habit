Similar stories exist in other fields. For example, military analysts
can identify which `blip` on a radar screen is an enemy missile and
which one is a plane from their own fleet even though they are
traveling at the same speed, flying at the same altitude, and look
identical on radar in nearly every respect. During the Gulf War,
Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship when
he ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly
like the battleship’s own planes on radar. He made the right call, but
even his `superior` officers couldn’t explain how he did it.

Museum `curators` have been known to `discern` the difference
between an `authentic` piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit
even though they can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off.
Experienced radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area
where a stroke will develop before any obvious signs are visible to the
untrained eye. I’ve even heard of hairdressers noticing whether a `client`
is `pregnant` based only on the feel of her hair.
