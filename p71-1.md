Your morning routine habit stack might look like this:

1. After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty
seconds.
2. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for
the day.
3. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin
my first task.

Or, consider this habit stack in the evening:
1. After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the
dishwasher.
2. After I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the
counter.
3. After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for
tomorrow morning.
