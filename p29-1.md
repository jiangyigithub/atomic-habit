Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a `momentary` change.

`Imagine` you have a `messy` room and you set a goal to clean it. If you
`summon` the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for
now. But if you maintain the same `sloppy`, `pack-rat habits` that led to a
messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new `pile` of
`clutter` and hoping for another `burst` of motivation. You’re left `chasing`
the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it.
You treated a `symptom` without addressing the cause.

Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the
`counterintuitive` thing about improvement. We think we need to
change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really
need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you
solve problems at the results level, you only solve them `temporarily`. In
order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems
level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

问题2：实现目标只是短暂的变化。

想象一下，你的房间很乱，你设定了一个目标来清理它。如果你能够调动精力整理一下，那么你的房间就会变得干净，至少暂时是这样。但是，如果你保持导致房间乱的那些懒散和囤积癖习惯，很快你就会再次面对新的杂乱堆积，并希望再次有动力来清理。你一直在追逐同样的结果，因为你从未改变背后的系统。你只是处理了一个症状，而没有解决根本原因。

实现目标只会在当下改变你的生活。这就是改进的违反直觉之处。我们认为我们需要改变结果，但结果并不是问题所在。我们真正需要改变的是导致这些结果的系统。当你在结果层面解决问题时，你只是暂时解决了它们。要真正改进，你需要在系统层面解决问题。修复输入，输出将自行修复。
