Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a `momentary` change.
`Imagine` you have a `messy` room and you set a goal to clean it. If you
`summon` the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for
now. But if you maintain the same `sloppy`, `pack-rat habits` that led to a
messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new `pile` of
`clutter` and hoping for another `burst` of motivation. You’re left `chasing`
the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it.
You treated a `symptom` without addressing the cause.
Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the
`counterintuitive` thing about improvement. We think we need to
change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really
need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you
solve problems at the results level, you only solve them `temporarily`. In
order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems
level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
