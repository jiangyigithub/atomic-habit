In humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system.
We perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.
But we also have other ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious,
but many are nonconscious. For instance, you can “notice” when the
temperature drops before a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises
during a `stomachache`, or when you fall off balance while walking on
rocky ground. `Receptors` in your body pick up on a wide range of
internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your blood or the need
to drink when thirsty.

The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is
vision. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors.
Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some
experts estimate that half of the brain’s resources are used on vision.
Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense,
it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest `catalyst`
of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can
lead to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how
important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with
productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.

Thankfully, there is good news in this respect. You don’t have to be
the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.
