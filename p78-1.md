In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that
makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in
their Environment, or B = f (P,E).

It didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business. In
1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called
Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a
product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.” In other words,
customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them
but because of how they are presented to them.

For example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than
those down near the floor. For this reason, you’ll find expensive brand
names featured in easy-to-reach locations on `store shelves` because
they drive the most profit, while cheaper alternatives are `tucked away`
in harder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which are the
units at the end of `aisles`. End caps are moneymaking machines for
`retailers` because they are obvious locations that encounter a lot of foot
traffic. For example, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come specifically
from end-of-the-aisle racks.
