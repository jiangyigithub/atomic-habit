The `ultimate` form of `intrinsic` motivation is when a habit becomes
part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who
wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person
who is this.

The more pride you have in a particular `aspect` of your identity, the
more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If
you’re `proud` of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to
care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps,
you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re
proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours
knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll `fight` tooth
and nail to maintain your habits.

True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit
because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that
it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can `convince` themselves to
visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t `shift` the
belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term
changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of
who you are.
