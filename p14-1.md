HOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOU

The entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a
great book, you must first become the book.” I originally learned about
the ideas mentioned here because I had to live them. I had to rely on
small habits to `rebound from` my injury, to get stronger in the gym, to
perform at a high level on the field, to become a writer, to build a
successful business, and simply to develop into a responsible adult. 
Small habits helped me fulfill my potential, and since you picked up 
the book , I'm guessing you'd like to fulfill yours as well. 

In the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for building 
better habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While science 
supports everything I've written, this book is not an academic research 
paper; it's an operating manual. You'll find wisdom and practical 
advice `front and center` as I explain the science of how to create and 
change your habits in a way that is easy to understand and apply. 
The fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy, 
psychology, and more—have been around for many years. What I offer 
you is a `synthesis` of the best ideas smart people figured out a long 
time ago as well as the most `compelling` discoveries scientists have 
made recently. My contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter 
most and connect them in a way that is highly actionable. Anything
wise in these pages you should `credit to` the many experts who 
`preceded` me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.
