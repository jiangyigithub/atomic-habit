This is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at
delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of
`substance abuse`, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress,
and `superior` social skills. We’ve all seen this play out in our own lives.
If you delay watching television and get your homework done, you’ll
generally learn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy `desserts`
and chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when you get
home. At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to
ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.

Here’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is
the wise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be
healthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-ofmind
at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself
to delay gratification—but you need to work with `the grain of` human
nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of
immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a
little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.
