HOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK 

In November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. For 
years, I had been keeping notes about my personal experiments with 
habits and I was finally ready to share some of them publicly. I began 
by publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a few 
months, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email 
subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to more 
than thirty thousand people. 

In 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand 
subscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on 
the internet. I had felt like an `impostor` when I began writing two years 
earlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits - a new 
label that excited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had never
considered myself a master of the topic, but rather someone who was
experimenting alongside my readers.
