The Downside of Creating Good Habits

HABITS CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR `MASTERY`. In chess, it is only after
the basic movements of the pieces have become automatic that a
player can focus on the next level of the game. Each chunk of
information that is memorized opens up the mental space for more
effortful thinking. This is true for any `endeavor`. When you know the
simple movements so well that you can perform them without
thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details. In
this way, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.

However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each
repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit
becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall
into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When
you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how
to do it better.

The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The
downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way
and stop paying attention to little errors. You `assume` you’re getting
better because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are `merely`
reinforcing your current habits—not improving them. In fact, some
research has shown that once a skill has been mastered there is usually
a `slight` decline in performance over time.
