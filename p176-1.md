There is, of course, a limit to this. If youâ€™re going to rely on
punishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment
must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct.
To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the
cost of action. To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than
the cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a restaurant or failing
to recycle adds consequence to an action. Behavior only shifts if the
punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.

In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the
consequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior. The
more global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less
likely it is to influence individual behavior.

Thankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost
to any bad habit: create a habit contract.
