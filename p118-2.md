These little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can help change
the feelings you associate with a particular habit or situation.

If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation
ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you
enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of
motivation. For instance, if you always play the same song before
having sex, then you’ll begin to link the music with the act. Whenever
you want to get in the mood, just press play.

Ed Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from a
similar strategy without knowing it. “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My
focus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on]
while writing. I don’t even have to play any music.” Without realizing
it, he was conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his
headphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did focused work.
After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones on
became a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus.
The craving followed naturally.
