All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit
is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit
`sprouts` and grows stronger. Roots `entrench` themselves and branches
grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak
within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a
`delicate` flower one day at a time.

But what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to
survive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other
side? What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits
and enables others to enjoy the compounding effects of good ones?

所有伟大的事物都起源于微小的开端。每个习惯的种子都是一个微小的决定。但是当这个决定被重复执行时，一个习惯就会开始生长并变得更加强大。根深蒂固，枝繁叶茂。打破一个不良习惯的任务就像连根拔起我们内心强大的橡树。而培养一个良好习惯的任务则像是一天天地培育一朵娇弱的花朵。

但是是什么决定了我们是否坚持习惯足够长的时间以度过"潜在潜能的高地"并突破到另一边？是什么导致一些人陷入不良习惯，使其他人能够享受良好习惯的复利效应呢？
