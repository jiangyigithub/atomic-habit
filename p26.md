All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit
is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit
`sprouts` and grows stronger. Roots `entrench` themselves and branches
grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak
within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a
`delicate` flower one day at a time.

But what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to
survive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other
side? What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits
and enables others to enjoy the compounding effects of good ones?
