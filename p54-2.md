Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask
yourself:

1. How can I make it obvious?
2. How can I make it attractive?
3. How can I make it easy?
4. How can I make it satisfying?

If you have ever wondered, “Why don’t I do what I say I’m going to
do? Why don’t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirement
or start that side business? Why do I say something is important but
never seem to make time for it?” The answers to those questions can
be found somewhere in these four laws. The key to creating good
habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws
and how to alter them to your specifications. Every goal is doomed to
fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.
