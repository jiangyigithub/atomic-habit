Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone
becomes addicted at home or with friends, goes to a `clinic` to get clean
—which is devoid of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their
habit—then returns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous
cues that caused them to get addicted in the first place. It’s no wonder
that usually you see numbers that are the exact opposite of those in the
Vietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users become readdicted
once they return home from rehab.

The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs
about bad habits because it challenged the conventional association of
unhealthy behavior as a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a
smoker, or an addict, you’ve been told your entire life that it is because
you lack self-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea
that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply
embedded in our culture.
