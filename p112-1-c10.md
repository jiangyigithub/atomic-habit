How to Find and Fix the Causes of YourBad Habits

IN LATE 2012, I was sitting in an old apartment just a few blocks from
Istanbul’s most famous street, Istiklal Caddesi. I was in the middle
of a four-day trip to Turkey and my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a
worn-out armchair a few feet away.

Mike wasn’t really a guide. He was just a guy from Maine who had
been living in Turkey for five years, but he offered to show me around
while I was visiting the country and I took him up on it. On this
particular night, I had been invited to dinner with him and a handful
of his Turkish friends.

There were seven of us, and I was the only one who hadn’t, at some
point, smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day. I asked one of
the Turks how he got started. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with
your friends. One friend smokes, then you try it.”
