When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to
slide into these `mental grooves` and accept them as a fact. In time, you
begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is
internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that
`is consistent with` your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid
`contradicting` yourself.

The more deeply a `thought` or action is tied to your identity, the
more difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what
your culture believes (group identity) or to do what `upholds` your self-
image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to
positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity
conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with
your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re
too busy or too tired or too `overwhelmed` or hundreds of other
reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick
with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you
can’t get too `attached` to one version of your identity. Progress requires
unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to
continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your
identity.

This brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and
worldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they
come from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed?
And how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve
you and `gradually` `erase` the pieces that `hinder` you?
