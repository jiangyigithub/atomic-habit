Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same
way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of
your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little
difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the
months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two,
five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the
cost of bad ones becomes `strikingly` apparent.

This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often
dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in
the moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a
`millionaire`. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of
shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t
learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never
seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.

习惯就像是自我改进的复利效应。就像金钱通过复利增长一样，习惯的效果也会随着重复而成倍增加。在任何给定的一天里，它们似乎并没有太大的区别，然而，它们在数月甚至数年的时间里所带来的影响是巨大的。只有当我们回顾两年、五年或者十年之后，良好习惯的价值和不良习惯的代价才会变得明显。

在日常生活中，这可能是一个难以理解的概念。我们经常对小的改变不屑一顾，因为它们在当下似乎并没有太大的意义。如果你现在存一点钱，你仍然不是百万富翁。如果你连续三天去健身房，你仍然不健康。如果你今晚学习一小时的中文，你仍然没有掌握这门语言。我们做了一些改变，但结果似乎从未迅速到来，于是我们又重新陷入之前的常规中。
