DECISIVE MOMENTS

Decisive moments set the options available to your future self. For
instance, walking into a restaurant is a decisive moment because it
determines what you’ll be eating for lunch. Technically, you are in
control of what you order, but in a larger sense, you can only order an
item if it is on the menu. If you walk into a steakhouse, you can get a
sirloin or a rib eye, but not sushi. Your options are constrained by
what’s available. They are shaped by the first choice.
