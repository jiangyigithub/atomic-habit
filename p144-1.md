We rarely think about change this way because everyone is
consumed by the end goal. But one push-up is better than not
exercising. One minute of guitar practice is better than none at all. One
minute of reading is better than never picking up a book. It’s better to
do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.

At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re
showing up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a
technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward
your ultimate goal. Start by mastering the first two minutes of the
smallest version of the behavior. Then, advance to an intermediate
step and repeat the process—focusing on just the first two minutes and
mastering that stage before moving on to the next level. Eventually,
you’ll end up with the habit you had originally hoped to build while
still keeping your focus where it should be: on the first two minutes of
the behavior.
