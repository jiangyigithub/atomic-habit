Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the
box. They would `poke` their nose into the corners, stick their `paws`
through openings, and `claw` at `loose` objects. After a few minutes of
exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door
would open, and they would escape.

Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many `trials`. In
the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as
soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of
learning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of
pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to
the food.
