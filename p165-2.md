Within eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the
firm. By age twenty-four, he was making $75,000 per year—the
`equivalent` of $125,000 today. Not long after, he `landed` a `six-figure` job
with another company.

I like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over
the years, I’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of
ways. One woman shifted a `hairpin` from one container to another
whenever she wrote a page of her book. Another man moved a `marble`
from one `bin` to the next after each set of push-ups.

Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving
paper `clips` or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your
progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit
of immediate satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes
in many forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty `punch` cards, the
`progress bar` on a software download, even the page numbers in a
book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a
habit tracker.
