When chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than
brittle. Like water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works
with the changing circumstances rather than against them.

The following quote from the Tao Te Ching `encapsulates` the ideas
perfectly:

Men are born soft and supple;
dead, they are stiff and hard.
Plants are born tender and pliant;
dead, they are brittle and dry.
Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible
is a disciple of death.
Whoever is soft and yielding
is a disciple of life.
The hard and stiff will be broken.
The soft and supple will prevail.
—LAO TZU

Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can
lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when
the world is shifting around us. Everything is `impermanent`. Life is
constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your
old habits and beliefs are still serving you.

A lack of self-awareness is `poison`. Reflection and review is the
`antidote`.
