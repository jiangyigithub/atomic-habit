How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

AFTER `SERVING AS` a pilot in World War II, Roger Fisher attended
Harvard Law School and spent thirty-four years specializing in
negotiation and conflict management. He `founded` the Harvard
Negotiation Project and worked with numerous countries and world
leaders on peace `resolutions`, `hostage` crises, and `diplomatic`
`compromises`. But it was in the 1970s and 1980s, as the threat of
nuclear war `escalated`, that Fisher developed perhaps his most
interesting idea.

At the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that could
prevent nuclear war, and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sitting
president would have access to launch codes that could kill millions of
people but would never actually see anyone die because he would
always be thousands of miles away.

“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that
[nuclear] code number in a little `capsule`, and then `implant` that
capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer. The volunteer would
carry with him a big, heavy `butcher` knife as he `accompanied` the
President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the
only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to
kill one human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m sorry but tens
of millions must die.’ He has to look at someone and realize what
death is—what an `innocent` death is. Blood on the White House `carpet`.
It’s reality brought home.
