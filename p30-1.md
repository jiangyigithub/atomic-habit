Problem #4: Goals are at `odds` with long-term progress.
Finally, a `goal-oriented` mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many
runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish
line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them.
When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left
to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find
themselves `reverting` to their old habits after `accomplishing` a goal.
The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of
building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term
thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single
accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and
continuous improvement. `Ultimately`, it is your commitment to the
process that will determine your progress.
