Problem #4: Goals are at `odds` with long-term progress.

Finally, a `goal-oriented` mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many
runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish
line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them.
When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left
to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find
themselves `reverting` to their old habits after `accomplishing` a goal.
The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of
building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term
thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single
accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and
continuous improvement. `Ultimately`, it is your commitment to the
process that will determine your progress.

问题4：目标与长期进步背道而驰。

最后，以目标为导向的心态可能会产生“上下起伏”的效应。许多跑步者在数月时间里努力训练，但一旦他们跨过终点线，他们就停止训练。比赛不再有动力激励他们。当你所有的努力都集中在一个特定的目标上时，当你实现它后，还剩下什么能推动你继续前进呢？这就是为什么许多人在实现目标后又回到了旧习惯的原因。设定目标的目的是赢得比赛。建立系统的目的是继续参与比赛。真正的长期思考是没有目标的思考。它不仅仅是关于单个成就，而是关于无休止的完善和持续改进的循环。最终，决定你进步的是你对过程的承诺。
