HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS

You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate
them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight
mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to
do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to
make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for
your family.

Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You
“get” to.

You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales
call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By
simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You
transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into
opportunities.

The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to
do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for
whatever mind-set we choose.
