Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you
want to be in the future. Even the tiniest action is `tinged with` the
motivation to feel differently than you do in the moment. When you
`binge-eat` or light up or browse social media, what you really want is
not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really
want is to feel different.

Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our
current state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course
of action. Neurologists have discovered that when emotions and
feelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions.
We have no signal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the
neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows
you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”

To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform
are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives.
Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a
craving to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social
media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you
to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with
positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather
than to our `detriment`.
