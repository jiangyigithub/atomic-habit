Now for the interesting question: If you `completely` ignored your
goals and `focused` only on your system, would you still succeed? For
example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to
win a championship and focused only on what your team does at
practice each day, would you still get results?
I think you would.
The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be
ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only
way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time
Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The
same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then
forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course
not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for
making progress. A handful of problems `arise` when you spend too
much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing
your systems.
