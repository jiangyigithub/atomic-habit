THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP

Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring
a neurotransmitter called dopamine.* The importance of dopamine
became `apparent` in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and
Peter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurological
processes behind craving and desire. By `implanting` `electrodes` in the
brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the
surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldn’t eat.
They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few days,
the animals died of `thirst`.

In follow-up studies, other scientists also `inhibited` the dopaminereleasing
parts of the brain, but this time, they `squirted` little `droplets`
of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-`depleted` rats. Their little rat
faces `lit up with` pleasurable `grins` from the tasty substance. Even
though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as
before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience
pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without
desire, action stopped.
