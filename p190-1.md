In college, I designed my own major, biomechanics, which was a
combination of physics, chemistry, biology, and anatomy. I wasn’t
smart enough to stand out among the top physics or biology majors, so
I created my own game. And because it suited me—I was only taking
the courses I was interested in—studying felt like less of a chore. It was
also easier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone else.
After all, nobody else was taking the same combination of classes, so
who could say if they were better or worse?

Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad
genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes
for others to compete with you. Many bodybuilders are stronger than
the average arm wrestler, but even a massive bodybuilder may lose at
arm wrestling because the arm wrestling champ has very specific
strength. Even if you’re not the most naturally gifted, you can often
win by being the best in a very narrow category.

Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t
control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a
game where it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more
favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one
where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.
