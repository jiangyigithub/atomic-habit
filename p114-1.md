Some of our underlying motives include:*

Win social acceptance and approval
Reduce uncertainty
Achieve status and prestige

A craving is just a specific `manifestation` of a deeper underlying
motive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or
to check Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply
want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social
acceptance and approval, or to achieve status.

Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and youâ€™ll see that
it does not create a new motivation, but rather `latches` onto the
underlying motives of human nature.
