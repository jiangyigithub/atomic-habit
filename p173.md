Chapter Summary

One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making
progress.

A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a
habit—like marking an X on a calendar.

Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make
your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your
progress.

Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.

Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as
quickly as possible.

Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the
most important thing.
