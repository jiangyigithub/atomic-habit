As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we
are to imitate some of their habits. One groundbreaking study tracked
twelve thousand people for thirty-two years and found that “a person’s
chances of becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a
friend who became obese.” It works the other way, too. Another study
found that if one person in a relationship lost weight, the other partner
would also slim down about one third of the time. Our friends and
family provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their
direction.

Of course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad
influences. When astronaut Mike Massimino was a graduate student
at MIT, he took a small robotics class. Of the ten people in the class,
four became astronauts. If your goal was to make it into space, then
that room was about the best culture you could ask for. Similarly, one
study found that the higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or
twelve, the higher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after
controlling for natural levels of intelligence. We soak up the qualities
and practices of those around us.
