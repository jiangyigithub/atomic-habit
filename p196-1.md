HOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON YOUR GOALS

After my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new sport. I joined
a weightlifting team and one day an elite coach visited our gym. He
had worked with thousands of athletes during his long career,
including a few Olympians. I introduced myself and we began talking
about the process of improvement.

“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone
else?” I asked. “What do the really successful people do that most
don’t?”

He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent.
But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it
comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day,
doing the same lifts over and over and over.”
