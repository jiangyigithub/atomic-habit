Chapter Summary

The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.

We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is
satisfying.

The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over
delayed rewards.

The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately
rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.
To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—
even if it’s in a small way.

The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it
attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior
will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change
—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be
repeated next time.
