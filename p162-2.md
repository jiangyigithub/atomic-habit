One of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted to
stop eating out so much and start cooking together more. They labeled
their savings account “Trip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going
out to eat, they transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the
year, they put the money toward the vacation.

It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards
that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.
Buying a new jacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more
books, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to `budget` and save money.
Instead, taking a `bubble bath` or going on a `leisurely walk` are good
examples of rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with your
ultimate goal of more freedom and financial independence. Similarly,
if your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re
casting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash.
Instead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a
vote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward is
aligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person.
