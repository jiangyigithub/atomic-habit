The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change

IN THE LATE 1990S, a `public health` worker named Stephen Luby left his
hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, and `bought` a `one-way ticket` to
Karachi, Pakistan.

Karachi was one of the most `populous` cities in the world. By 1998,
over nine million people called it home. It was the `economic center` of
Pakistan and a `transportation hub`, with some of the most active
airports and seaports in the `region`. In the commercial parts of town,
you could find all of the standard urban `amenities` and `bustling`
downtown streets. But Karachi was also one of the least `livable cities`
in the world.

Over 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in `squatter settlements`
and `slums`. These `densely packed` neighborhoods were filled with
`makeshift houses` `cobbled together` from old boards, cinder blocks, and
other discarded materials. There was no waste removal system, no
electricity grid, no clean water supply. When dry, the streets were a
combination of dust and trash. When wet, they became a muddy pit of
sewage. Mosquito colonies `thrived` in pools of stagnant water, and
children played among the garbage.
