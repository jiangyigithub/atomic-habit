Let’s break down each one.

Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.
Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next
one. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the
streak of X’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log.
When you look at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded
to act again. Research has shown that people who track their progress
on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood
pressure are all more likely to improve than those who don’t. One
study of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept
a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. The
mere act of tracking a behavior can `spark` the urge to change it.
Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a `distorted`
view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do.
Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own
behavior and notice what’s really going on each day. One glance at the
paper clips in the container and you immediately know how much
work you have (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence is right
in front of you, you’re less likely to `lie to yourself`.
