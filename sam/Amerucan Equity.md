American Equity

I'd like feedback on the following idea.
我想听听对以下观点的反馈。

I think that every adult US citizen should get an annual share of the US GDP.
我认为每位美国成年公民都应该获得美国国内生产总值的年度份额。

I believe that owning something like a share in America would align all of us in making the country as successful as possible—the better the country does, the better everyone does—and give more people a fair shot at achieving the life they want.
我认为拥有类似美国的份额将使我们大家共同努力使国家尽可能成功—国家表现越好，每个人都会表现得更好—并使更多人有机会实现他们想要的生活。

And we all work together to create the system that generates so much prosperity.
而且我们都共同努力创造这个创造如此多繁荣的系统。

I believe that a new social contract like what I’m suggesting here—where we agree to a floor and no ceiling—would lead to a huge increase in US prosperity and keep us in the global lead.
我相信我在这里建议的这种新社会契约—我们同意设立底线但不设上限—将会导致美国繁荣大幅增长，并保持我们在全球的领先地位。

Countries that concentrate wealth in a small number of families do worse over the long term—if we don’t take a radical step toward a fair, inclusive system, we will not be the leading country in the world for much longer. This would harm all Americans more than most realize.
那些把财富集中在少数家庭的国家在长期内表现得更差—如果我们不采取激进的措施建立一个公平、包容的系统，我们将不再是世界领先的国家。这将对所有美国人造成比大多数人意识到的更大的伤害。

There are historical examples of countries giving out land to citizens (such as the Homestead Acts in the US) as a way to distribute the resources people needed to succeed. Today, the fundamental input to wealth generation isn’t farmland, but money and ideas—you really do need money to make money.
历史上有国家向公民分配土地的例子（比如美国的农地法案），作为分配人们成功所需资源的一种方式。如今，财富创造的基本要素不再是农田，而是资金和创意—确实需要资金来赚钱。

American Equity would also cushion the transition from the jobs of today to the jobs of tomorrow. Automation holds the promise of creating more abundance than we ever dreamed possible, but it’s going to significantly change how we think about work. If everyone benefits more directly from economic growth, then it will be easier to move faster toward this better world.
美国权益还将减轻从今天的工作到未来工作的过渡。自动化技术有望创造比我们曾梦想的更多的丰富，但它将显著改变我们对工作的看法。如果每个人都能更直接地从经济增长中受益，那么更快地迈向这个更美好的世界将更容易实现。

The default case for automation is to concentrate wealth (and therefore power) in a tiny number of hands. America has repeatedly found ways to challenge this sort of concentration, and we need to do so again.
自动化的默认情况是将财富（因此也是权力）集中在极少数人手中。美国一再找到挑战这种集中的方法，我们需要再次这样做。

The joint-stock company was one of the most important inventions in human history. It allowed us to align a lot of people in pursuit of a common goal and accomplish things no individual could. Obviously, the US is not a company, but I think a similar model can work for the US as well as it does for companies.
股份有限公司是人类历史上最重要的发明之一。它使我们能够让很多人为共同的目标而努力，完成任何个人无法完成的事情。显然，美国不是一家公司，但我认为类似的模式对美国同样有效，就像对公司一样。

A proposal like this obviously requires a lot of new funding [1] to do at a large scale, but I think we could start very small—a few hundred dollars per citizen per year—and ramp it up to a long-term target of 10-20% of GDP per year when the GDP per capita doubles.
这样的提案显然需要大量新的资金[1]来实施大规模，但我认为我们可以从非常小的规模开始—每位公民每年几百美元—然后逐步提高到长期目标，即每年国内生产总值的10-20%，当国内生产总值达到翻倍时。

I have no delusions about the challenges of such a program. There would be difficult consequences for things like immigration policy that will need a lot of discussion. We’d also need to figure out rules about transferability and borrowing against this equity. And we’d need to set it up in a way that does not exacerbate short-term thinking or favor unsustainable growth.
我对这个计划的挑战没有幻想。例如，对于移民政策等事项，会有困难的后果，需要进行大量讨论。我们还需要制定关于权益可转让和借贷的规则。并且我们需要以一种不加剧短期思维或偏好不可持续增长的方式设置它。

However, as the economy grows, we could imagine a world in which every American would have their basic needs guaranteed. Absolute poverty would be eliminated, and we would no longer motivate people through the fear of not being able to eat. In addition to being the obviously right thing to do, eliminating poverty will increase productivity.
然而，随着经济的增长，我们可以想象一个世界，在这个世界中，每个美国人的基本需求都得到了

保障。绝对贫困将被消除，我们将不再通过对不能吃饭的恐惧来激励人们。除了明显正确的做法外，消除贫困将提高生产力。

American Equity would create a society that I believe would work much better than what we have today. It would free Americans to work on what they really care about, improve social cohesion, and incentivize everyone to think about ways to grow the whole pie.
美国权益将创建一个社会，我相信它将比我们今天拥有的社会运作得更好。它将使美国人能够从事他们真正关心的工作，提高社会凝聚力，并激励每个人思考如何增加整个蛋糕的方式。

[1] It’s time to update our tax system for the way wealth works in the modern world—for example, taxing capital and labor at the same rates. And we should consider eventually replacing some of our current aid programs, which distort incentives and are needlessly complicated and inefficient, with something like this.
[1] 现在是时候根据现代世界财富运作的方式来更新我们的税收制度—例如，以相同的税率对资本和劳动进行征税。并且我们应该考虑最终用类似这种方式替代一些当前的援助计划，这些计划扭曲了激励，过于复杂和低效。

Of course this won’t solve all our problems—we still need serious reform in areas such as housing, education, and healthcare. Without policies that address the cost of living crisis, any sort of redistribution will be far less effective than it otherwise could be.
当然，这不会解决我们所有的问题—我们仍然需要在住房、教育和医疗等领域进行严重改革。如果没有解决生活成本危机的政策，任何形式的再分配都将远不如其本应有的有效。
