huge-scale destruction of jobs, and concentration of huge power

Technology provides leverage on ability and luck, and in the process concentrates wealth and drives inequality.


The Software Revolution
软件革命

In human history, there have been three great technological revolutions and many smaller ones. The three great ones are the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, and the one we are now in the middle of—the software revolution.
在人类历史上，有三次重大技术革命和许多较小的革命。这三次重大的革命分别是农业革命、工业革命，以及我们现在正在经历的软件革命。

The great technological revolutions have affected what most people do every day and how society is structured. The previous one, the industrial revolution, created lots of jobs because the new technology required huge numbers of humans to run it. But this is not the normal course of technology; it was an anomaly in that sense. And it makes people think, perhaps subconsciously, that technological revolutions are always good for most people’s personal economic status.
重大技术革命影响了大多数人的日常生活以及社会结构。上一个革命，即工业革命，创造了大量工作机会，因为新技术需要大量人类来运行。但这并不是技术的正常发展过程；在这个意义上，它是一个异常。这让人们认为，也许是下意识地认为，技术革命总是对大多数人的个人经济状况有利。

It appears that the software revolution will do what technology usually does—create wealth but destroy jobs. Of course, we will probably find new things to do to satisfy limitless human demand. But we should stop pretending that the software revolution, by itself, is going to be good for median wages.
看来，软件革命将会做通常的技术所做的事情—创造财富但破坏工作机会。当然，我们可能会找到新的事情来满足无限的人类需求。但我们应该停止假装软件革命本身会对中位工资有益。

Technology provides leverage on ability and luck, and in the process concentrates wealth and drives inequality. I think that drastic wealth inequality is likely to be one of the biggest social problems of the next 20 years.
技术提供了对能力和运气的杠杆作用，从而集中财富并导致不平等。我认为极端的财富不平等很可能是未来20年最大的社会问题之一。

Trying to hold on to worthless jobs is a terrible but popular idea. Trying to find new jobs for billions of people is a good idea but obviously very hard because whatever the new jobs are, they will probably be so fundamentally different from anything that exists today that meaningful planning is almost impossible. But the current strategy—“let’s just pretend that Travis is kidding when he talks about self-driving cars and that Uber really is going to create millions of jobs forever”—is not the right answer.
试图保住毫无价值的工作是一个可怕但流行的想法。试图为数十亿人找到新工作是一个好主意，但显然非常困难，因为不管新的工作是什么，它们可能与今天存在的任何东西都有根本不同，以至于几乎不可能进行有意义的规划。但当前的策略——“我们只是假装特拉维斯在谈论自动驾驶汽车时在开玩笑，而优步真的会创造数百万个永久性工作”—并不是正确的答案。

The second major challenge of the software revolution is the concentration of power in small groups. This also happens with most technological revolutions, but the last truly terrifying technology (the atomic bomb) taught us bad lessons in a similar way to the industrial revolution and job growth.
软件革命的第二个重大挑战是权力集中在小团体中。这也发生在大多数技术革命中，但上一个真正可怕的技术（原子弹）以类似于工业革命和就业增长的方式教给我们糟糕的教训。

It is hard to make an atomic bomb not because the knowledge is restricted (though it is—if I, hypothetically, knew how to make an atomic bomb, it would be tremendously illegal for me to say anything about it) but because it takes huge amounts of energy to enrich Uranium. One effectively needs the resources of nations to do it.
制造原子弹很困难，不是因为知识受到限制（尽管它受到限制——如果我假设知道如何制造原子弹，我说出来将是非常违法的），而是因为需要大量能量来富集铀。实际上，制造原子弹需要国家的资源。

Again, this is not the normal course for technology—it was an idiosyncrasy of nuclear development. The software revolution is likely to do what technology usually does, and make more power available to small groups.
再次强调，这不是技术的正常发展过程—这是核技术发展的特殊情况。软件革命很可能会做通常的技术所做的事情，使更多的权力集中在小团体手中。

Two of the biggest risks I see emerging from the software revolution—AI and synthetic biology—may put tremendous capability to cause harm in the hands of small groups, or even individuals. It is probably already possible to design and produce a terrible disease in a small lab; development of an AI that could end human life may only require a few hundred people in an office building anywhere in the world, with no equipment other than laptops.
我认为从软件革命中出现的两个最大风险——人工智能和合成生物学——可能会使小团体甚至个人拥有引发严重伤害的巨大能力。很可能已经有可能在一个小型实验室中设计和制造可怕的疾病；开发一个能够终结人类生命的人工智能可能只需要全球任何一座办公大

楼中的几百人，除了笔记本电脑外，不需要任何设备。

The new existential threats won’t require the resources of nations to produce. A number of things that used to take the resources of nations—building a rocket, for example—are now doable by companies, at least partially enabled by software. But a rocket can destroy anything on earth.
新的存在威胁不需要国家的资源来制造。过去需要国家资源的一些事情，比如制造火箭，现在可以由公司完成，至少在某种程度上是由软件支持的。但一枚火箭可以摧毁地球上的任何东西。

What can we do? We can’t make the knowledge of these things illegal and hope it will work. We can’t try to stop technological progress.
我们能做什么？我们不能将这些知识非法化并希望它会奏效。我们不能试图阻止技术进步。

I think the best strategy is to try to legislate sensible safeguards but work very hard to make sure the edge we get from technology on the good side is stronger than the edge that bad actors get. If we can synthesize new diseases, maybe we can synthesize vaccines. If we can make a bad AI, maybe we can make a good AI that stops the bad one.
我认为最佳策略是设法立法制定明智的安全措施，但要努力确保我们从技术的积极方面获得的优势比坏行为者获得的优势更大。如果我们能合成新疾病，也许我们可以合成疫苗。如果我们可以制造恶意人工智能，也许我们可以制造一个良好的人工智能来制止恶意者。

The current strategy is badly misguided. It’s not going to be like the atomic bomb this time around, and the sooner we stop pretending otherwise, the better off we’ll be. The fact that we don’t have serious efforts underway to combat threats from synthetic biology and AI development is astonishing.
当前的策略是严重误导的。这一次不会像原子弹那样，越早停止假装否则，我们就会更好。我们没有正在进行严肃的努力来应对合成生物学和人工智能发展的威胁，这事实令人震惊。

To be clear, I’m a fan of the software revolution and I feel fortunate I was born when I was. But I worry we learned the wrong lessons from recent examples, and these two issues—huge-scale destruction of jobs, and concentration of huge power—are getting lost.
明确地说，我是软件革命的支持者，我觉得自己很幸运出生在这个时代。但我担心我们从最近的例子中学到了错误的教训，而这两个问题——大规模的工作破坏和大规模的权力集中——正在被忽视。
