My teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the
long walk to the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back
into school. Random hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We
took our time and walked slowly. Nobody realized that every minute
mattered.

When we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of
questions.

“What year is it?”

“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.
