The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can
be easier to change in a new environment. It helps to `escape` the subtle
triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a
new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of
your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.

It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build
a new habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to
bed early if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be
hard to study in the living room without getting distracted if that’s
where you always play video games. But when you step outside your
normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You
aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to
form without interruption.

Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a `rooftop`
`patio`, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the
space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your
current thought patterns.
