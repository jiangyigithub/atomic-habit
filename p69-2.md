Why is this important?

When it comes to building new habits, you can use the
connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to
build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day
and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.

Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention.
Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and
location, you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was
created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to
design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.*
