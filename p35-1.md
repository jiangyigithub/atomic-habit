Imagine two people resisting a `cigarette`. When offered a smoke, the
first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to `quit`.” It sounds like a
reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker
who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will
change while carrying around the same beliefs.

The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a
smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement `signals` a shift in
identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one.
They no longer identify as someone who smokes.

Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out
to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I
stick to this `diet`, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They `set` goals and
determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without
considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the
way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old
identity can `sabotage` their new plans for change.
