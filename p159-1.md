It is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that
society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.*
Compared to the age of the brain, modern society is brand-new. In the
last one hundred years, we have seen `the rise of` the car, the airplane,
the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone,
and Beyoncé. The world has changed much in recent years, but human
nature has changed little.

Similar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestors
spent their days responding to `grave threats`, securing the next meal,
and taking shelter from a storm. It made sense to place a high value on
instant gratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And
after thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment,
our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.
