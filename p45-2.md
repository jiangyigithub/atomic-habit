WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become
automatic. The process of habit formation begins with `trial and error`.
Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to
make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come
across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat,
you’re just trying things out to see what works.

`Neurological` activity in the brain is high during this period. You are
carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about
how to act. You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to
make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective
course of action.

Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you `stumble` across a
solution. You’re feeling `anxious`, and you discover that going for a run
calms you down. You’re mentally `exhausted` from a long day of work,
and you learn that playing video games relaxes you. You’re exploring,
exploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.
