In an article published in the New Yorker titled “Better All the
Time,” James Suroweicki writes:
“Japanese firms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean
production,’ `relentlessly` looking to remove waste of all kinds from the
production process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workers
didn’t have to waste time `twisting and turning` to reach their tools. The
result was that Japanese factories were more efficient and Japanese
products were more reliable than American ones. In 1974, service calls
for American-made color televisions were five times as common as for
Japanese televisions. By 1979, it took American workers three times as
long to assemble their sets.”

I like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.* The
Japanese companies looked for every point of friction in the
manufacturing process and eliminated it. As they `subtracted` wasted
effort, they added customers and revenue. Similarly, when we remove
the points of friction that `sap` our time and energy, we can achieve
more with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good:
we are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the cognitive
load our environment places on us.)
