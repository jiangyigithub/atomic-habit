He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing.
He took a job as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to land
his own appearances on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked
his way into being a regular guest on The Tonight Show and Saturday
Night Live.

Finally, after nearly fifteen years of work, the young man rose to
fame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two
cities in eighty days. Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. He had
18,695 people attend one show in Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were
sold for his three-day show in New York. He catapulted to the top of
his genre and became one of the most successful comedians of his
time.

His name is Steve Martin.

Martin’s story offers a fascinating perspective on what it takes to
stick with habits for the long run. Comedy is not for the timid. It is
hard to imagine a situation that would strike fear into the hearts of
more people than performing alone on stage and failing to get a single
laugh. And yet Steve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen
years. In his words, “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining,
and 4 years as a wild success.”
