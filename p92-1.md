Tinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round
object, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The
bigger the object, the greater their response. One goose even made a
`tremendous` effort to roll a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby
gulls automatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was
following an instinctive rule: When I see a round object nearby, I must
roll it back into the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I
should try to get it.

It’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for
behavior, and when it comes across an `exaggerated` version of that
rule, it lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these
exaggerated cues as `supernormal` stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a
heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg
the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.
