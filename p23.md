WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE

Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you.
The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-
five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.
Twenty-six degrees.
Twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight.
The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.
Twenty-nine degrees.
Thirty.
Thirty-one.
Still, nothing has happened.

Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift,
seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has
unlocked a huge change.

Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous
actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major
change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent
of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo
can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root
systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within
six weeks.

Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross
a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early
and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of
Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and
it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,
weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere.
It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful
outcomes are delayed.
