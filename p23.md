WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE

Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you.
The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-
five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.
Twenty-six degrees.
Twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight.
The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.
Twenty-nine degrees.
Thirty.
Thirty-one.
Still, nothing has happened.

Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to `melt`. A one-degree shift,
seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has
unlocked a huge change.

Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous
actions, which build up the potential required to `unleash` a major
change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent
of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo
can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root
systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within
six weeks.

Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross
a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early
and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of
Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and
it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,
weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere.
It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful
outcomes are delayed.

你的习惯可以为你积累利益，也可以对你产生负面影响。

正向复利
生产力具有复利效应。每天完成一个额外的任务在任何一天都只是一个小小的成就，但在整个职业生涯中却占据了很大的份额。自动化旧任务或掌握新技能的效果甚至更为显著。你越能处理不需思考的任务，你的大脑就越能自由地专注于其他领域。
知识具有复利效应。学习一个新观点并不会使你成为天才，但终身学习的承诺可以带来转变。此外，你阅读的每一本书不仅会教给你新知识，还会以不同的方式打开你对旧观点的思考方式。正如沃伦·巴菲特所说：“这就是知识的运作方式。它像复利一样积累。”
人际关系具有复利效应。人们会以你的行为为镜像。你帮助别人越多，别人就越想帮助你。在每一次互动中稍微友善一些，随着时间的推移，你将建立起广泛而强大的人际关系网络。

负向复利
压力具有复利效应。交通堵塞的沮丧，育儿责任的沉重，收支不平的担忧，稍高的血压带来的紧张感。这些压力的常见原因本身是可以应对的。但当它们持续多年时，小小的压力会累积成严重的健康问题。
负面思维具有复利效应。你越是认为自己一无是处、愚蠢或丑陋，你就越会使自己倾向于以这种方式解读生活。你会陷入思维循环中。对他人的看法也是如此。一旦你养成了将人视为愤怒、不公正或自私的习惯，你会在每个地方看到那种人。
愤怒具有复利效应。骚乱、抗议和群众运动很少是单个事件的结果。相反，一系列的微小挑衅和日常恼人之事会慢慢地累积，直到某个事件使天平倾斜，愤怒像野火一样蔓延开来。
