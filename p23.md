WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE

Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you.
The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-
five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.
Twenty-six degrees.
Twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight.
The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.
Twenty-nine degrees.
Thirty.
Thirty-one.
Still, nothing has happened.

Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to `melt`. A one-degree shift,
seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has
unlocked a huge change.

Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous
actions, which build up the potential required to `unleash` a major
change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent
of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo
can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root
systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within
six weeks.

Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross
a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early
and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of
Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and
it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,
weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere.
It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful
outcomes are delayed.

进展的真实样貌

想象一下，在你面前的桌子上放着一个冰块。房间很冷，你能看到自己呼出的气息。当前的温度是摄氏25度。房间开始缓慢地变热。

26度。
27度。
28度。
冰块依然静静地放在桌子上。
29度。
30度。
31度。
然而，仍然没有任何变化。

然后，32度。冰开始"融化"。一个看似和之前的温度升高没有什么不同的一度变化，却引发了巨大的变化。

突破性的时刻往往是之前许多行动的结果，这些行动累积起来，为"释放"一场重大变革提供了必要的潜力。这种模式无处不在。癌症在80%的时间里无法被察觉，然后在几个月内迅速侵袭整个身体。竹子在地下建立广泛的根系五年时间几乎看不见，然后在六周内迅速生长到九十英尺高。

同样，习惯往往在你跨越关键的阈值并实现新的表现水平之前似乎没有任何差异。在任何目标的早期和中期阶段，通常会有一个"失望谷"。你期望进展是线性的，但在最初的几天、几周，甚至几个月里，改变似乎无效。感觉好像一事无成。这是任何复利过程的标志：最强大的结果是被延迟的。
