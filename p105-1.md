Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of
Behavior Change and make our habits more attractive.

1. Imitating the Close
   
Proximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of the
physical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true
of the social environment.

We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our
parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another,
the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you
give it a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that
the door is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.

I find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me without
realizing it. In conversation, Iâ€™ll automatically assume the body
posture of the other person. In college, I began to talk like my
roommates. When traveling to other countries, I unconsciously imitate
the local accent despite reminding myself to stop.
