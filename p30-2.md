A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS
If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you.
The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and
again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the
wrong system for change.
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your
systems.
Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of
the core `themes` of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings
behind the word atomic. By now, you’ve probably realized that an
atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent
improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however
small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as
atoms are the building blocks of `molecules`, atomic habits are the
building blocks of remarkable results.
Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental
unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny
routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel
bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of
their initial investment. They are both small and `mighty`. This is the
meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine
that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible
power; a component of the system of `compound` growth.
