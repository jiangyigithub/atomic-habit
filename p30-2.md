A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS

If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you.
The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and
again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the
wrong system for change.

You do not `rise` to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your
systems.

Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of
the core `themes` of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings
behind the word atomic. By now, you’ve probably realized that an
atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent
improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however
small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as
atoms are the building blocks of `molecules`, atomic habits are the
building blocks of remarkable results.

Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental
unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny
routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel
bigger wins that `multiply` to a degree that far outweighs the cost of
their initial `investment`. They are both small and `mighty`. This is the
meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine
that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible
power; a component of the system of `compound growth`.

一个原子习惯的体系

如果你在改变习惯方面遇到困难，问题不是出在你身上，而是出在你的体系上。不良习惯一次又一次地重复出现，不是因为你不想改变，而是因为你采用了错误的改变体系。

你的水平不会升至目标的高度，而是下降至你的体系水平。

专注于整体体系，而不仅仅是单一目标，是本书的核心主题之一。这也是原子一词背后更深层次的含义之一。你现在可能已经意识到，原子习惯指的是微小的改变，边际增益，1%的提升。然而，原子习惯并不仅仅是任何小习惯。它们是较大体系中的小习惯。就像原子是分子的构建块一样，原子习惯是卓越成果的基石。

习惯就像我们生活中的原子。每个习惯都是对整体改进的基本单元。起初，这些微小的日常看似微不足道，但很快它们相互累积并推动着更大的胜利，这种胜利的成倍增长远远超过了它们最初的投入成本。它们既小巧又强大。这就是"原子习惯"这个短语的含义——一种定期的实践或例行公事，不仅小而易行，而且具有令人难以置信的力量；它是"复合增长"体系的组成部分。
