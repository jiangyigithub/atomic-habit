We can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.

It would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four laws are an
exhaustive framework for changing any human behavior, but I think
theyâ€™re close. As you will soon see, the Four Laws of Behavior Change
apply to nearly every field, from sports to politics, art to medicine,
comedy to management. These laws can be used no matter what
challenge you are facing. There is no need for completely different
strategies for each habit.

Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask
yourself:

1. How can I make it obvious?
2. How can I make it attractive?
3. How can I make it easy?
4. How can I make it satisfying?
