Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far
more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually
bnildty
accomplish these things. When the votes mount
up and the evidence
begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.
Of course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to
perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that
you don’t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be
votes for both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an
election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few
votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply
to win the majority of the time.
New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same
votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve
always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.
