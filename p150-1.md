Of course, there are many ways to automate good habits and
eliminate bad ones. Typically, they involve putting technology to work
for you. Technology can transform actions that were once hard,
annoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and
simple. It is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right
behavior.

This is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too
infrequently to become habitual. Things you have to do monthly or
yearly—like `rebalancing your investment portfolio`—are never repeated
frequently enough to become a habit, so they benefit in particular from
technology “remembering” to do them for you.

Other examples include:
Medicine: `Prescriptions` can be automatically refilled.

Personal finance: Employees can save for retirement with an
automatic wage deduction.

Cooking: Meal-delivery services can do your `grocery shopping`.

Productivity: Social media browsing can be cut off with a website
blocker.
