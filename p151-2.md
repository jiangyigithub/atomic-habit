During the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new
time management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset
the passwords on all my social media accounts, which logged me out
on each device. All week I worked without distraction. On Friday, she
would send me the new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy
what social media had to offer until Monday morning when she would
do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up with a friend or
family member and reset each other’s passwords each week.)

One of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted. Within the
first week of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t
need to check it nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t
need it each day. It had simply been so easy that it had become the
default. Once my bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did
actually have the motivation to work on more meaningful tasks. After I
removed the mental candy from my environment, it became much
easier to eat the healthy stuff.
