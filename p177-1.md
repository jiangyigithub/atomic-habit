Bryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, Tennessee, was the
first person I saw put this strategy into action. Shortly after the birth of
his son, Harris realized he wanted to `shed` a few pounds. He wrote up a
habit contract between himself, his wife, and his personal trainer. The
first version read, “Bryan’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eating
correctly again so he feels better, looks better, and is able to hit his
long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10% body fat.”

Below that statement, Harris `laid out` a road map for achieving his
ideal outcome:

Phase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.
Phase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking program in Q2.
Phase #3: Refine and maintain the details of his diet and workout
program in Q3.

Finally, he wrote out each of the daily habits that would get him to
his goal. For example, “Write down all food that he consumes each day
and weigh himself each day.”
