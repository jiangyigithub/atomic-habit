The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an
implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about
when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a
particular habit.

The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the
feel of your phone `buzzing` in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip
cookies, the sound of `ambulance sirens`—but the two most common
cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both
of these cues.

Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation
intention is:
“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”
