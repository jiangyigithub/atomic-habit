Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.

The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a
signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to
continue `down that path`. In this way, habit tracking can have an
`addictive effect` on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.

This can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling
down, it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made.
Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle
reminder of how far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each
morning can motivate you to get started because you don’t want to
lose your progress by breaking the streak.
