You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your
identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You
can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you
choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book
and the real reason habits matter.

Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks.
It’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower
each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about
achieving external measures of success like earning more money,
losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of
these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something.
They are about becoming someone.

Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the
type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you
develop your `deepest` beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you
become your habits.
