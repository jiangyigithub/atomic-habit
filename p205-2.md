Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all
habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you
consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can
`make excuses`, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no
process for determining whether we are performing better or worse
compared to yesterday.

Top performers in all fields `engage in` various types of reflection and
review, and the process doesn’t have to be complex. Kenyan runner
Eliud Kipchoge is one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an
Olympic gold `medalist`. He still takes notes after every practice in
which he reviews his training for the day and searches for areas that
can be improved. `Similarly`, gold medal swimmer Katie Ledecky
records her wellness `on a scale of` 1 to 10 and includes notes on her
nutrition and how well she slept. She also records the times posted by
other swimmers. At the end of each week, her coach goes over her
notes and adds his thoughts.

It’s not just athletes, either. When comedian Chris Rock is
preparing fresh material, he will first appear at small nightclubs
dozens of times and test hundreds of jokes. He brings a notepad on
stage and records which bits go over well and where he needs to make
adjustments. The few killer lines that survive will form the backbone of
his new show.
