The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become
driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your
success is measured by quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales,
revenue, and accounting for quarterly earnings. If your success is
measured by a lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a
lower number on the scale, even if that means embracing crash diets,
juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to “win”
whatever game is being played.

This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working
long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more
about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We
teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity,
and critical thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure.
When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.

This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the
economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure
becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is
only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not
when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in
the overall system.
