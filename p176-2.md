THE HABIT CONTRACT

The first seat belt law was passed in New York on December 1, 1984.
At the time, just 14 percent of people in the United States regularly
`wore a seat belt`—but that was all about to change.

Within five years, over half of the nation had seat belt laws. Today,
wearing a seat belt is `enforceable` by law in forty-nine of the fifty states.
And it’s not just the legislation, the number of people wearing seat
belts has changed dramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of
Americans `buckled up` each time they got in a car. In just over thirty
years, there was a complete `reversal` in the habits of millions of people.

Laws and regulations are an example of how government can
change our habits by creating a social contract. As a society, we
`collectively` agree to `abide by certain rules` and then enforce them as a
group. Whenever a new piece of legislation impacts behavior—seat belt
laws, banning smoking inside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is
an example of a social contract shaping our habits. The group agrees to
act in a certain way, and if you don’t `follow along`, you’ll be punished.

Just as governments use laws to hold citizens `accountable`, you can
create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is
a `verbal` or written agreement `in which` you state your commitment to
a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t
follow through. Then you find one or two people to act as your
accountability partners and `sign off` on the contract with you.
