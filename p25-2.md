When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential,
people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the
most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know
that it’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t
making any progress—that makes the jump today possible.

It is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic
plates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension
slowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once
again, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension
is too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it
happens all at once.

Mastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most
successful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer
Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help,
I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a
hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the
hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that
last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”

当你最终突破了"潜在潜能的高地"时，人们会称之为一夜之间的成功。外界只看到最引人注目的事件，而不是它之前的一切。但是你知道，正是你很久以前所做的工作——即使在看似没有任何进展的时候——使得今天的飞跃成为可能。

这相当于地质压力在人类身上的等价物。两个构造板块可以相互摩擦数百万年，紧张感一直在逐渐增加。然后，有一天，它们再次像往常一样相互摩擦，但这一次紧张感太大了。地震爆发了。改变可能需要多年时间，然后突然发生。

掌握技能需要耐心。圣安东尼奥马刺队是NBA历史上最成功的球队之一，他们更衣室里挂着社会改革家雅各布·里斯的一句名言：“当似乎没有任何帮助时，我会去看一个石匠敲击他的岩石，或许敲击了一百次，没有一丝裂缝出现。然而，在第一百零一次敲击时，岩石会被劈成两半，而我知道不是最后一次敲击造成了这一切，而是之前的所有工作。”
