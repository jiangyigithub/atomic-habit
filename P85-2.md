Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that
completely `upended` the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins
found that when soldiers who had been `heroin` users returned home,
only 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12
percent `relapsed` within three years. In other words, `approximately`
nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in `Vietnam` eliminated their
addiction nearly overnight.

This finding `contradicted` the `prevailing` view at the time, which
considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and `irreversible`
condition. Instead, Robins revealed that addictions could
`spontaneously` dissolve if there was a `radical` change in the
environment. In Vietnam, soldiers spent all day surrounded by cues
triggering heroin use: it was easy to access, they were `engulfed` by the
constant stress of war, they built friendships with `fellow` soldiers who
were also heroin users, and they were thousands of miles from home.
Once a soldier returned to the United States, though, he found himself
in an environment `devoid` of those triggers. When the context
changed, so did the habit.
