Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged
`sword`. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force
for self-improvement. When working against you, `though`, identity
change can be a `curse`. Once you have `adopted` an identity, it can be
easy to let your `allegiance` to it impact your ability to change. Many
people walk `through` life in a `cognitive` `slumber`, `blindly` following the
norms `attached` to their identity.

“I’m terrible with directions.”
“I’m not a morning person.”
“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”
“I’m always late.”
“I’m not good with technology.”
“I’m `horrible` at math.”
. . . and a thousand other `variations`.
