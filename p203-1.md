HOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

In 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talented
basketball teams ever `assembled`, but they are rarely remembered that
way. The team started the 1985–1986 NBA season with an `astounding`
29–5 record. “The `pundits` were saying that we might be the best team
in the history of basketball,” head coach Pat Riley said after the
season. Surprisingly, the Lakers `stumbled` in the 1986 playoffs and
suffered a season-ending defeat in the Western Conference Finals. The
“best team in the history of basketball” didn’t even play for the NBA
championship.

After that `blow`, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent
his players had and about how much `promise` his team held. He didn’t
want to see `flashes` of brilliance followed by a gradual fade in
performance. He wanted the Lakers to play up to their potential, night
after night. In the summer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly
that, a system that he called the Career Best Effort program or CBE.
