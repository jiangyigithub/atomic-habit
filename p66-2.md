Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions
are effective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the
exact time and date of when you will `get a flu shot` or recording the
time of your colonoscopy appointment. They increase the odds that
people will stick with habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep
early, and stopping smoking.

Researchers have even found that voter `turnout` increases when
people are forced to create implementation intentions by answering
questions like: “What route are you taking to the polling station? At
what time are you planning to go? What bus will get you there?” Other
successful government programs have prompted citizens to make a
clear plan to send taxes in on time or provided directions on when and
where to pay late traffic bills.

The `punch line` is clear: people who make a specific plan for when
and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow
through. Too many people try to change their habits without these
basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier”
or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these
habits are going to happen. We `leave it up to` chance and hope that we
will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time. An
implementation intention `sweeps away` foggy notions like “I want to
work out more” or “I want to be more productive” or “I should vote”
and transforms them into a concrete plan of action.
