The childhood of the Polgar sisters was `atypical`, to say the least.
And yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle was
attractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the sisters talk about their
childhood as entertaining rather than `grueling`. They loved playing
chess. They couldn’t get enough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found
Sofia playing chess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.
Encouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Sofia, leave the pieces
alone!” To which she replied, “Daddy, they won’t leave me alone!”

The Polgar sisters `grew up` in a culture that prioritized chess above
all else—praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an
`obsession with` chess was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever
habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive
behaviors you’ll find.

THE `SEDUCTIVE` PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS

Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to `bond with` others, and
to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such `inclinations` are
essential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our
ancestors lived in `tribes`. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse,
being `cast out`—was a death sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the pack
survives.”*
