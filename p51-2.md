All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes
the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain
it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you
want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the
problems you face.

In the table on the following page, you can see a few examples of
what this looks like in real life.

You have performed this simple habit so many times that it occurs
without thinking. You proceed through all four stages in the `fraction` of
a second. The urge to act strikes you without thinking.
