When scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they
found that the hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in `spatial`
memory—was significantly larger in their subjects than in non–taxi
drivers. Even more fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size
when a driver retired. Like the muscles of the body responding to
regular weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as they
are used and `atrophy` as they are abandoned.

Of course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits was
recognized long before neuroscientists began `poking around`. In 1860,
the English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak
a new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform
`unaccustomed` movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels
through which each `sensation` has to pass have not become
established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than
this difficulty `vanishes`; the actions become so automatic that they can
be performed while the mind is `otherwise engaged`.” Both common
sense and scientific evidence agree: repetition is a form of change.
