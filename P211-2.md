In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless
because they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one
coin wonâ€™t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one
minute or reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable
difference.

Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of
one another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like
adding a `grain` of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly `tilting`
things in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping
point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of
the system is working for you rather than against you.
