Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is
to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition,
you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t
say why. As the writer Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never
going to just work out without conscious thought. But like a dog
`salivating` at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day
you normally work out.”

There are many ways to use implementation intentions in your life
and work. My favorite approach is one I learned from Stanford
professor BJ Fogg and it is a strategy I refer to as habit stacking.
