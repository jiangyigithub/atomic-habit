Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy,
and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing
the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You
do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a
habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside
encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity
sustains a habit.

That said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new
identity to emerge. Immediate reinforcement helps maintain
motivation in the short term while you’re waiting for the long-term
rewards to arrive.

In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits
of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a
refreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can
offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is
easy when it is enjoyable.
