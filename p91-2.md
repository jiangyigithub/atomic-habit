However, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the `cardboard`
`beak`, they pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother.
They had a clear preference for those red spotsâ€”as if they had been
genetically programmed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the
bigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked. Eventually, he created
a beak with three large red dots on it. When he placed it over the `nest`,
the baby birds went crazy with `delight`. They pecked at the little red
`patches` as if it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.

Tinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other
animals. For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird.
Occasionally, as the mother moves around on the nest, one of the eggs
will roll out and settle on the grass nearby. Whenever this happens,
the goose will `waddle` over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull
it back into the nest.
