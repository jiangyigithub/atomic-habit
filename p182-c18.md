The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Donâ€™t)

MANY PEOPLE ARE familiar with Michael Phelps, who is widely
considered to be one of the greatest athletes in history. Phelps
has won more Olympic medals not only than any swimmer but also
more than any Olympian in any sport.

Fewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was a
fantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner
who holds two Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-
distance runners of all time. For many years, he held the world record
in the mile, 1,500-meter, and 2,000-meter races. At the Olympic
Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter
and 5,000-meter races.

These two athletes are wildly different in many ways. (For starters,
one competed on land and the other in water.) But most `notably`, they
differ significantly in `height`. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches tall.
Phelps is six feet, four inches tall. Despite this seven-inch difference in
height, the two men are identical in one respect: Michael Phelps and
Hicham El Guerrouj wear the same length `inseam` on their `pants`.

How is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for his height
and a very long `torso`, the perfect build for swimming. El Guerrouj has
incredibly long legs and a short upper body, an ideal frame for
distance running.
