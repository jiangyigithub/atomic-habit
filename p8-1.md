“Who is the president of the United States?”

“Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.

“What is your mom’s name?”

“Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.

“Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten
seconds to remember my own mother’s name.

That is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle
the rapid swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the
ambulance arrived. Minutes later, I was carried out of school and
taken to the local hospital.

Shortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled
with basic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first
seizure of the day. Then I stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors
hurried to supply me with oxygen, they also decided the local hospital
was unequipped to handle the situation and ordered a helicopter to fly
me to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.
