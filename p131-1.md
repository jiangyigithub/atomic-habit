The spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd Law of
Behavior Change on a global scale. `Conventional` wisdom holds that
motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it,
youâ€™d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy
and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity
best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a `dumb` one.

Energy is precious, and the brain is `wired` to conserve it whenever
possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which
states that when deciding between two similar options, people will
naturally `gravitate` toward the option that requires the least amount of
work.* For example, expanding your farm to the east where you can
grow the same crops rather than heading north where the climate is
different. Out of all the possible actions we could take, the one that is
realized is the one that delivers the most value for the least effort. We
are motivated to do what is easy.
