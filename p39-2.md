Of course, your habits are not the only actions that influence your
identity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most
important ones. Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but
it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you
kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you
repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-
image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade
away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means
your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.
In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of 
becoming yourself.

This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our
fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit,
day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing
microevolutions of the self.

Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If
you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes
reading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person
who likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are
the type of person who likes music.
