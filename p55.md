Your habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chapters
that follow, we will discuss these laws one by one and show how you
can use them to create a system in which good habits emerge naturally
and bad habits `wither` away.

Chapter Summary

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to
become automatic.

The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life
with as little energy and effort as possible.

Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves
four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.

The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we
can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2)
make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.
