The unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease.
Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting,
and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children living there were
malnourished. With so many people crammed into such a small space,
viruses and bacterial infections spread rapidly. It was this public
health crisis that had brought Stephen Luby to Pakistan.

Luby and his team realized that in an environment with poor
sanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands could make a real
difference in the health of the residents. But they soon discovered that
many people were already aware that handwashing was important.

And yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing their
hands in a haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their hands
under the water quickly. Others would only wash one hand. Many
would simply forget to wash their hands before preparing food.
Everyone said handwashing was important, but few people made a
habit out of it. The problem wasnâ€™t knowledge. The problem was
consistency.

That was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gamble
to supply the neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to your
standard bar of soap, using Safeguard was a more enjoyable
experience.
