“When players first join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we track
their basketball `statistics` all the way back to high school. I call this
Taking Their Number. We look for an accurate `gauge` of what a player
can do, then build him into our plan for the team, based on the `notion`
that he will maintain and then improve upon his averages.”

After determining a player’s baseline level of performance, Riley
added a key step. He asked each player to “improve their output by at
least 1 percent over the course of the season. If they succeeded, it
would be a CBE, or Career Best Effort.” Similar to the British Cycling
team that we discussed in Chapter 1, the Lakers `sought` peak
performance by getting slightly better each day.
