Eventually, I took my own advice and redesigned my environment.
I bought a large display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchen
counter. The next time I bought apples, that was where they wentâ€”out
in the open where I could see them. Almost like magic, I began eating
a few apples each day simply because they were obvious rather than
out of sight.

Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make
the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:

If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put
your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom
counter.

If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar
stand in the middle of the living room.

If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a
stack of stationery on your desk.

If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each
morning and place them in common locations around the house.
